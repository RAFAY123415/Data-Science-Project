" October 17, 2023",Reviewed in the United States ,William Smith,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just received DURGOD TGK021 Gaming Keyboard with Magnetic Wrist Rest and Brown switches.. Packaging was nice, box was new and unopened and the contents arrived undamaged. I like the removeable USB C cable option. As USB C cables go, this one was on the thick side but I prefer that as I believe it will hold up to wear and tear better. When everything was unwrapped, I set it up on my desk without plugging it in. My current keyboard had a keyboard stand and it's own wrist support. I wanted to see what configuration felt the best. I had three basic configuration options. 1. Use both the new keyboard and the new wrist rest; 2. Use new keyboard on my keyboard stand with the keyboard stand's wrist rest, or 3. Use the new keyboard on the keyboard stand and use the new keyboard's wrist rest. I opted to go with option 3 as it placed the keyboard at the most comfortable angle while using the wrist support that came with it. I should note that going with option 3 prevented the backlighting from working on the wrist rest. I was ok with this because the wrist rest's lighting on the one I received did not work. When you plugged in the USB C cable, the wrist rest will light up for a split second and then go out. So with the backlight feature not available, there was no drawback with using it with the stand.. Keys and typing: Like others, I've spent well over $1k trying to find the right keyboard (for me). I've gone through every type and color of key and switch. I don't use the system for gaming, it's 100% work for me. But that doesn't mean my expectations/requirements are any less than a gamer's. The keys themselves seem just a little narrower than what I'd like. As in their width is smaller than my other full size keyboards. As such, I find myself striking the edge of keys from time to time. I'm sure that will pass the more I use the keyboard. A lot of reviews talk about the sound striking the keys make and how smooth pressing the keys feels. The brown keys on this keyboard are about the same volume as other brown switches and the same goes for the smoothness of the key press. But what people don't really mention in the reviews is the key's stiffness or resistance to being pressed. I really like the key's stiffness on this board. For me, it requires the right amount of effort to strike the key. That combined with the audible sound of the keys is a perfect fit. So all in all, I really like the way the key strike feels on this board. I'd give feel and sound of the keys a 9 out of 10.. Backlighting: Sitting for long hours behind the computer in my home office, I often work with the lights off or dimmed way down. It's less strain for my eyes. Besides the wrist rest's backlighting not working out of the box, the keyboard's RGB lighting meets my expectations. The instructions are a little on the non-intuitive side. It took me a couple minutes looking through all the options to figure out how to change the RGB and backlighting setting. I don't want any light movement and I prefer a solid static color. Once you figure out what the instructions are telling you, setting the color and pattern of the key's backlighting was simple. But here is my second con of this keyboard. Despite reading the instructions and playing with the different options, I could not figure out how to get the lighting around the edge of the keyboard to stop moving. I would have liked to make the trim's lighting static and the same color as the backlighting for the keys. Because the wrist rest lighting didn't work at all and I couldn't find out how to set the trim's lighting, I have to give the RGB lighting feature a 4.. Appearance: The look and feel of this keyboard is pretty good. It's got a fair amount of weight to it which can help keeping it from sliding around on your desk. I feels solid and well built. There's not a whole lot of cushion on the wrist rest but what is there is comfortable. I don't set up a lot of macros or customize my keyboards as it's not really necessary for my work. But I will say the layout is good. And even though the key faces aren't as wide as I'd like them, the keys themselves are spaced apart at what I think is standard for a full sized keyboard.. Cost: At $95.00, the keyboard isn't what I'd call inexpensive but it's about half of what I have paid for the other keyboards I've bought and tested. I think I'd like to see this keyboard priced around $60.00 to $70.00 price range. Its quality is definitely above the $20-$40 class of keyboards but doesn't offer a lot of the options that the $110+ keyboards offer. So in terms of cost vs quality, I have to give this a 6 out of 10 because the wrist rest didn't work out of the box. Otherwise, I think I would have given it a 7 out of 10.. Over all: Despite the issues I've stated above, I plan on keeping this keyboard (as is) and will start using it as my main keyboard. I didn't buy the keyboard for the trim lighting or the wrist rest. My goal was to find a keyboard where the keys felt right to me and the keys were able to be statically backlight. This keyboard met both of my goals. The key width and lighting issues were minor and not enough for me to not like using the keyboard. This review is the first thing I've typed using this keyboard and it really was a pleasure using it. I am hopeful that my quest to find the perfect keyboard for me is finally over. Hope this review helps.",5.0 out of 5 stars,/Ollyn-Mechanical-Keyboard-Hot-swappable-Anti-Skid/dp/B0BN1C79P6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,"DURGOD TGK021 Gaming Keyboard with Magnetic Wrist Rest, RGB Backlit, and Hot-Swap Linear Red Switch - 104 Keys Mechanical Wired Keyboard for PC/Mac/Laptop, Fully Anti-ghosting, Multi-Media Keys"
" July 5, 2023",Reviewed in the United States ,Brett,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this keyboard because I wanted a 65% low profile rgb keyboard. The build quality is really good. It is compact, looks great, and the layout is perfect. The keys feel great and the rgb looks good. Little details like storage for the dongle and a good quality usb-c cable make it feel even more premium. The main issues I had with the keyboard were the rgb coloring and the switches. This keyboard does not have software to adjust the color of the rgb lighting. The stock colors controlled vis the keyboard are okay but it needs to have more options and the edge lit coloring did not match up to the key backlighting. When I switched the backlight to white it looked pink. When I tried to adjust the edge lit rgb to match it did not offer a white. A little thing but it drove me crazy. I could not customize the colors to what I wanted. The keycaps feel excellent. The switches on the keyboard are very very quiet. For some that may be great, but as for me I like a little sound. The is one of the big reasons people buy a mechanical keyboard. My biggest issue with the switches is definitely the typing feel. They feel a bit mushy. It would be great if they offered a tactile option. A brown switch on this keyboard would great. If they had software to control the rgb and edge lighting so I could customize the color to what I wanted and offered a tactile switch this would be the perfect keyboard. If you aren't too worried about the rgb colors being specific and you like red switches then this keyboard is a great value.",4.0 out of 5 stars,/Ollyn-Mechanical-Keyboard-Hot-swappable-Anti-Skid/dp/B0BN1C79P6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,"DURGOD TGK021 Gaming Keyboard with Magnetic Wrist Rest, RGB Backlit, and Hot-Swap Linear Red Switch - 104 Keys Mechanical Wired Keyboard for PC/Mac/Laptop, Fully Anti-ghosting, Multi-Media Keys"

" May 7, 2023",Reviewed in the United States ,Liu Weinan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Im more a programmer than a gamer actually. I bought this to replace my old mechanical keyboard as shown in the photo comparison. The new one is full size, build quality is exceptional. The sleek, black design with customizable RGB lighting is not only visually appealing but also adds a touch of personalization to my work studio. The keycaps have a premium feel, well tuned dull soft metal clicks sound, and the anti-ghosting feature ensures that all of my key presses are accurately registered. Long work sessions can be taxing on your hands and wrists, but this keyboard has addressed that issue with an ergonomic design and a detachable comfortable wrist rest. It also comes with two snitch tools that I assume is for easy keycaps removal and cleaning.

" December 19, 2020",Reviewed in the United States ,Miguel,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Premium packaging and premium feeling keyboard with good weight to it. However, for the price, the spacebar rattles when you type and also the RGB wave that is made in one of the RGB modes is choppy. I feel like at this price point, they could've done a better job, especially when a cheaper alternative like RK Pro packs more functionality and is more refined.. However, this keyboard does have slightly grippier textured keys. If you like that it's great, but to me, that doesn't really matter. I feel like it would slow me down a bit when typing, but one can argue it gives better control when gaming? Although I've never had mis-clicks with normal textured or even slippery textured keycaps.. The dealbreaker for me is, the windows key is smaller than standard size, because they enlarged the control key. I need to use this keyboard to code on Mac/Linux, and the window key turns into the command key on Mac, so I need it to be at least normal size, preferably a bit bigger. When I say small, I mean the window key is smaller than even the Z key right above it. Kinda boggles the mind that they would pay extra to have that manufactured and have an extra part in the assembly line just for that. That I think is where your money went if you paid for the keyboard.. If you ONLY use this keyboard for gaming, I can see this being a good premium choice, if the spacebar rattle doesn't bother you, or if you in fact like it. If you need to use it with Mac too then forget it. Even if you use it for normal productivity on Windows, I would think the smaller windows key will bother you at some point.. FYI I needed to use this keyboard for work, typing chats and emails, coding on Mac/linux, and gaming on PC.. P.S. They do use genuine MX Cherry switches. I checked by pulling of one keycap and the switch is indeed MX Cherry branded. In my mind, MX Cherry is the best mass produced keyboard switches. You can go boutique with proprietary switches like Logitech, but then you are going to pay a lot more.",4.0 out of 5 stars,/ASUS-RGB-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard/dp/B08412SYV6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,"ASUS RGB Mechanical Gaming Keyboard - ROG Strix Scope TKL | Cherry MX Brown Switches | 2X Wider Ctrl Key for FPS Precision | Gaming Keyboard for PC, Black"

" June 22, 2021",Reviewed in the United States ,MOTOxICON,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Keyboard itself is pretty good. I was mostly looking for a keyboard with rgb all the way around the switch unlike what I had with my huntsman elite and I also like the aesthetic look of ROG it's just a shame it's tied to Armory crate and aura because my goodness my experience with it over a few different products is garbage. I know people have different experiences and some say it's good and ICUE or Gigabytes software is bad but it just doesn't work most of the time for me. It either freezes the rgb after a few minutes or skips frame by frame instead of a smooth transition in color and even if it does stay working it won't the next time I boot my pc. The only temporary fix I had was to turn the performance mode or whatever it is on and off in the settings and again this only lasted for like 2 minutes. The saving grace for all of this is Asus allows you to change the rgb on the keyboard itself without any software but if you have an Asus mouse too kiss customization goodbye for the mouse without the software. It's really a shame because I wanted to get an ROG motherboard too but until they fix their software I'm good lol.,4.0 out of 5 stars,/ASUS-RGB-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard/dp/B08412SYV6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,"ASUS RGB Mechanical Gaming Keyboard - ROG Strix Scope TKL | Cherry MX Brown Switches | 2X Wider Ctrl Key for FPS Precision | Gaming Keyboard for PC, Black"

I've been wanting a old school keyboard for some time and decided to try the TKL with Cherry Brown switches. It is good. I would like a bit more feedback at the top, but it is good enough. I don't miss the ""click"", typing fast on this keyboard makes enough clicky noises as the keys bottom out anyway.. Size is good, the weight of the keyboard was surprisingly heavy - a good thing in my opinion. More that adequate rubber feet to keep it from moving around; in fact, you have to pick it up and put it where you want it. It does not slide well at all.. A couple of things to note, mine did not come with a palm rest and as I get lazy, my outer left palm tends to start laying on the CTRL key and I sometimes get weird things happening as the CTRL gets pressed with whatever else I'm typing. Considering a palm rest to see if that helps. The Ten Key Less format is pretty compact - laptop sized. I am wondering if the keys are slightly pushed together...feels a little cramped sometimes. I am seriously considering getting another of the series, but in the full size to hopefully have a little more spacing.",4.0 out of 5 stars,/ASUS-RGB-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard/dp/B08412SYV6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,"ASUS RGB Mechanical Gaming Keyboard - ROG Strix Scope TKL | Cherry MX Brown Switches | 2X Wider Ctrl Key for FPS Precision | Gaming Keyboard for PC, Black"

The MX brown switches are pefect. The TKL size is great and gives you a lot more room for your mouse to swing around at low DPI. The build quality is exactly what you expect from ROG. The extra large Ctrl button is GREAT for crouching. All in all the best FPS gaming keyboard for the money. Compared to the Strix Flare I use as my everyday this thing is tiny. Key spacing is the same, just a much smaller frame. Not sure it would be great for a daily driver but for gaming there is none better.

It has a wider left Control key which is usually used for ducking, looking around corners, depending on your game. You just have to move a bit to hit the Control key, whereas on a normal keyboard, you would hit the Windows key a lot. This keyboard also does not have the 10-Key pad on the side making it a bit smaller, which gives me room to use my Asus Balteus mouse pad. It has the RGB, if you're into the lighting, and sync's with all your Asus RGB gear. It also has a Stealth key, that when pressed, minimizes all open windows, and mutes any sound, in case you're playing a game and you should be doing homework.

" October 16, 2020",Reviewed in the United States ,F. Gabriel,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm going to preface this review by saying that my last couple of keyboards have been enthusiast board, so I was going to be hard to please in this regard. I decided to try this after rebuilding my personal PC with Asus Rog parts and thought it would be fun to be able to sync all of the RGB together, and to my delight it worked!. The board is great at doing that. The entire setup syncs together with the Aura sync app and adds a great feel to my desk. This is also genuinely one of the comfiest keyboards I've ever had the pleasure of typing on (I chose MX Reds) . I was super excited to try the retooled cherry switches and see how they felt. I'm pleasantly impressed. In that regard the board really succeeds.. My issue, however is with the build quality of the board itself. The first one I received had extremely sticky switches on the Ctrl, shift, and enter keys. In addition: I discovered that when plugged in I can hear a high pitched whine coming through my headphones. Lastly: plugging the thing in proved to be a real pain, as the housing around USB C cable that it comes with seems to be slightly too large for the port itself. It took me a solid few minutes to understand how to plug this thing in so it gets the right contact points. I eventually decided to give it the benefit of the doubt and RMA it and receive a new one, maybe I had a bad unit.. The second one is better, but still had at least one sticky key that I had to repair myself, and *still* produces the whining noise if my headphones aren't playing any sound. After tinkering around with it, I finally discovered that this was due to the DAC amp that I had plugged in via USB, as plugging headphones directly into the motherboard did not reproduce the issue. But, honestly, the fact that no other keyboard I own does this speaks more to the board's engineering than it does to the setup.. I'm disappointed, mostly because I really REALLY wanted to like this board. It almost ticks all the right boxes for me, but the fact that I had to do so much tinkering and fixing just to make the thing work as a basic functional keyboard for my work-from-home setup makes me feel like even for the sale price of $109 that I received it for doesn't even feel worth it..

In general, I like the keyboard. The MX Brown switches are nice, it's hefty and feels solid, and overall seems decent. The biggest problem I have with it is the LED backlights for the keys. About 6-ish months into owning the keyboard, the LED lights failed and certain keys were stuck on the wrong color backlight. I contacted ASUS support and they were relatively helpful. I RMAed the keyboard, which unfortunately the shipping cost about 1/3 the total cost of the keyboard. But, in a week or two, they sent me a replacement (appeared to be a refurb, but whatever). Now, here I am 1 year and 1 day from my purchase date and I again have LED backlights that have decided to do whatever they want. However, now, ASUS says I'm out of warranty and I'm just apparently SOL. I guess I either need to just live with it, or buy a different brand, because I'm certainly not buying another ASUS keyboard.

Floyd,3.0 out of 5 stars,"While I own three shops vacs, I needed something portable but would still pick up job site waste (sawdust, drywall dust, wood chunks, etc). This unit does all that. Suction is good for its size. I like that it takes the newer 20V packs and seems to last a couple hours (actual use time) on one charge.. It would have been nice if it came with a brush attachment and maybe space to store at least one more attachment.. That said, there is one major design flaw. The exhaust port is located in the side of the unit near the center. So, you blow as much dust as you gather. For that reason, the unit is completely worthless in an enclosed space (e.g., a cabinet or closet). You can either buy a longer hose and keep the unit away from where you're cleaning. In which case you can't conveniently store the hose and will lose some suction.. Or you can buy a diffuser (aka muffler), however, I could not find a diffuser for a 1.25"" port. So, you have to also buy a 2.5"" to 1.25"" reducer. But since they located the exhaust port on the side of the unit, you now have a diffuser which sticks out several inches from the side. You could also buy a 90 degree elbow so the protrusion is upward but will suffer additional loss in suction. Additional, as the diffuser itself will reduce suction somewhat..

I then made every upgrade up through Mathcad 8.0 Standard in 1998, but stopped upgrading after that due to cost, irregular and sometimes infrequent use, and the fact the Mathcad 8.0 Standard handled just about everything I needed Mathcad to handle.. Unfortunately, while Mathcad 8.0 Standard ran fine for me under Windows Vista and Windows XP, it does not always play nice with Windows 7, so when Mathcad Prime 3.0 was released I decided to upgrade in spite of the cost. I had tested Mathcad Prime 2.0 using PTC's 30-day free trial (after which it reverted to the very basic Mathcad Prime Express), but found too much still missing for what I needed. Mathcad Prime 3.0 is the first version that is more than adequate for me in most areas. I realize that the hardcore Mathcad 15 users are still not impressed with Mathcad Prime 3.0, but I like it a lot.

Mathcad Prime 3.0 is a quantum leap for me, especially since I had never done any programming. Maxfield does an excellent job explaining Mathcad Prime 3.0 from the ground up. The book is very well organized and his explanations are detailed, yet clear. Maxfield includes many examples, some contrived and some real-world. Since I am a civil engineer like Brent Maxfield, some of his real world examples are right down my alley. Rather than just stopping with descriptions of WHAT Mathcad Prime 3.0 can do (like most manuals), Maxfield offers useful commentary on HOW to use Mathcad Prime 3.0. He also points out some deficiencies with Mathcad Prime 3.0 and a bug related to symbolic SOLVE modifiers. I had stumbled across this myself, but thought I was doing something wrong. Maxfield's book confirmed it was a bug.. Maxfield's book has enhanced my Mathcad productivity and knowledge in ways I cannot fully explain. I have learned new techniques and reinforced old ones. Going through this book inspired me to upgrade a number of my old Mathcad 8.0 Standard worksheets into Mathcad Prime 3.0 format and to create new ones from scratch and then share these with the Mathcad community. Perhaps the best way to explain how useful Maxfield's book has been to me is to point you to the nearly two dozen Mathcad Prime 3.0 worksheets I have posted to date in the PTC Community ([...]). In each case, I have included both the Mathcad Prime 3.0 worksheet and--for users of earlier versions of Mathcad or for people considering Mathcad--an Adobe Acrobat .pdf file.",5.0 out of 5 stars,/Essential-PTC%C2%AE-Mathcad-Prime%C2%AE-3-0/dp/012410410X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,Essential PTC¬Æ Mathcad Prime¬Æ 3.0: A Guide for New and Current Users
" November 17, 2014",Reviewed in the United States ,Jos√© Vera Campello,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is called Essential and that is fine for it will not teach you how to deal with every feature of Mathcad Prime.. However, it is far more comprehensive that some would expect, and it can also be considered as a Bible for Mathcad, at least with regards to what you can get to do when you finish the book.. It is a very well written book, the style is simple and straightforward, there are lots of tricks you have to learn about Mathcad to get going an this book tells you all about tricks and workarounds.. I was mentioning that the book can be understood as a reference book, or a Bible, for Mathcad, and this is true when you realize that the best you can do is to follow the book starting from Chapter 1 and doing all exercises to the very end. This way you can get really acquainted of all you can do with Mathcad Prime. In that sense, this book works the same way that a bible for SolidWorks or Excel would work. You simply read the whole book from A to Z and you get the point.. You can skip chapters you do not need to read, but for someone who is new to Mathcad, reading the complete book works best.. The examples are actually very easy to follow, there are no mistakes in the book as far as I am concerned, which is also a good point since meany technical reference books are full of typos or mistakes. In that sense, this book outperforms other technical books. At the end of each chapter, there are lots of exercises to be done, and some engineering examples as well, although those are very elementary but useful to the reader.. I would recommend this book to someone who is to learn Mathcad.",5.0 out of 5 stars,/Essential-PTC%C2%AE-Mathcad-Prime%C2%AE-3-0/dp/012410410X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,Essential PTC¬Æ Mathcad Prime¬Æ 3.0: A Guide for New and Current Users

" May 11, 2014",Reviewed in the United States ,Kyle Nguyen,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm an engineering student and I wanted to learn a computer software that could help me with calculations for a school project. For some reason I managed to hunker down and complete the whole book in about 2-3 days. This speaks to how readable (and fun!) this book is, helped by the fact that Mathcad is one of the most accessible math programs available. I'm glad I picked up Mathcad Prime instead of the regular Mathcad because, amongst other reasons, I love the different, and customizable, math labels in Prime. For example, I can set my variables to be red, functions green, and constants orange. This makes it easy to spot errors in Mathcad, and not to mention fun to read! (I know I sound like a 12-year-old girl right now). I'm sure there are some functions in the old Mathcad that are not included in Mathcad Prime (as evidenced by the lamentations of Mathcad users on the web), but I just need some basic functions and Prime, for now, suffices.. The most useful chapters for me are the last chapter where Mr Maxfield teaches us how to set a default template so that I don't have to change the formats or labels when creating a new Mathcad notebook. His chapter on unit (and how to use them with finesse) is also valuable because one of Mathcad's strengths is its scarily amazing handling of units. Every chapter in his book is chocked full of examples (very useful!) and tips to handle Mathcad.. Thanks to this book, I'm now primarily using Mathcad to do calculations for my homework and projects. My units are never wrong; I could check my answers by plugging in numbers to my functions and compare that to my solutions; and I could correct one wrong number without redoing my calculations. I love the feeling of making my classmates jealous, yet in awe of the same time at my multicolored Mathcad notebooks.

I downloaded the 30 day full Mathcad offer from PTC, then purchased the book to find how to use it. By the time I got the book and started working through it my subscription had elapsed. The Mathcad reverted to what they call Mathcad Express; which from my point of view is absolutely useless; they have removed any functionality that has any purpose. So as far as the book is concerned, it has been consigned to the bottom of my scrap book pile, and probably get dumped next time I have a clear up.

" October 19, 2023",Reviewed in the United States ,Eduardo Urquidi,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If your Mercedes is supported by this vendor and looking to lowering you vehicle, this is a great product. Highly recommended and super easy installation. If you lower your vehicle the feel will change, but there are many variables to consider: spring, shock, tire. In this situation, the module only lowers the vehicle and dose not change anything else.. If you are happy with the current ride quality, I would recommend not lowering your vehicle. I was not happy with the ride quality at all, as I do not like soft and squishy suspensions. Lowering helped with removing the giggle I was feeling in my suspension. I know this what most people like, but I did not buy the AMG model for a soft ride. The lowering helped with that and feel this is how the vehicle should have come from the factory. It now feels sporty, not harsh, without the high center of gravity and nervous feel. Lowering the center of gravity is what changed the feeling, and I am so glad I did! Function over form!. I did an even drop front and rear, to ensure the suspension performed as designed. I believe there was a 6mm difference, with the rear being higher. So I left it that way. I did not want to lower the vehicle to level out the suspension for a look.. For this, I used the low setting provided, which is a 32mm drop front and rear.. Hope this review helps, as I want to support vendors that offer a great product without a ridiculous markup.

" February 17, 2019",Reviewed in the United States ,Soung Hun Gi,4.0 out of 5 stars,"So I unknowingly bought this keyboard thinking that i can hot swap them for Kailh Box Navy switches but turns out they use optical sensors rather than the two prong contacts. That being said, the quality of the item is very good. The keycaps are doubleshot ABS so the legends are never going away but they are unusually shiny on the side. The keys are mounted on an aluminium plate and are easy to remove. They also give you a keycap remover but the one they give in the box does not have a stabilizer cap remover which is annoying if you decide to switch them later on.. Now we come to the switches, Gateron Optical Switches. These are very smooth switches because of the lack of contact. But since this keyboard comes blue switches that still mimic Cherry MX blues, the key sound is very rattly. I would like to see the keyboard come with more options of optical switches like red or black or have them be easier to get shipped over.",4.0 out of 5 stars,/SKYLOONG-Mechanical-Keyboard-Programmable-Swappable/dp/B08CB1KZS2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,SKYLOONG GK61 SK61 60% Mechanical Keyboard 61 Keys Portable Small Full Keys Programmable Gaming Keyboard Red Switch Hot Swappable RGB Mechanical Keyboard for PC Mac Laptop

We then discovered a small, inconspicuous symbol just above speed setting #1 in the shape of a drill bit or small wood screw and came to the conclusion that this speed setting is for light drilling operations or the driving of very small screws only.

So take this review with that grain of salt.. First I love the feel of the tool, the look and footprint (size) is perfect for what I want. I am still considering getting it again.. But here is why it is getting the one star. The customer service was so terrible, that I can‚Äôt give the product a good review. This impact, came in as a potato. It worked a total of 30 minutes under lite foot work. No hard impacting at all, no drops or anything that should cause it to stop working. It is an internal break, likely the chuck. The motor still fires, the electric and all still reads fine. Just no spinning at all. So my first solution to this was contact dewalt learn of what fixes they have. I spent two weeks trying to get a good solution, hurting and wasting my time to return and my own work (since this was a work purchase). Respectfully I wanted dewalt to handle it and every solution they gave, they turned around after I had to confirm, that those services were for only people state side. Now, first off they had my address, and I had told them over the two week span on emails, I do not live in the US. But I respectfully checked each solution they provided because, I want to have a good working relation with the brands I buy tools from. The experience was terrible, the first contact didn‚Äôt even replace the tags meant to make the email look personalized. They sent me to the international dewalt site as an end to the communication. I assumed, okay just one bad egg, I contact the Japanese site and inform the US site that they should consider checking customer satisfaction on their service lately since my first contact was terrible. Next, the Japanese site confirms that they can‚Äôt handle the issue and send it to the US dewalt again and I am back in communication with Dewalt, state side. They ask for the same information on the drill again (of course) and use the same copy paste email but at least change the tags to my name and impact drill. Small things but nice to see. So I continue respectfully, give the details I can and they say they can‚Äôt do anything online or over the phone so I need to ship it in. I then look at the service and inform them, that I can‚Äôt. As it is a service for only people living in the states. After that communication, I just inform them that I will return it. Which ends up being a bill on my end since the shipping is going to cost more than what Amazon will cover, and knowing it as a used and broke product is only going to get thrown away. It is disappointing, understandable but disappointing.. The customer service for international customers gets a 0. The product I wish I could fully rate but the use time, I honestly can‚Äôt give it a fair rating. So again, take the one star with a grain of salt.

" November 5, 2023",Reviewed in the United States ,Valerie W.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Yes, the camera works with Apple's Mac Mini with the M1 chip running macOS Sonoma 14.0. I read mixed results in the reviews and questions. I'm guessing those who had issues missed some basic setup steps. Here's my experience, and I hope it helps others.. I connected the camera to one of the two USB ports on the back of the Mini. I have a USB hub for other components, but I plugged the camera directly into the computer. I then tried FaceTime and Zoom, and the camera worked, although the image appeared very grainy, especially for a 1080P unit. I did a reboot, but that didn't help.. I then went to the Emeet website to figure out how to adjust the image quality. I downloaded their EMEETLINK software for Mac. Once installed, the image quality improved. I could use the software to change things such as sharpness, contrast, and white balance. I still don't consider it crystal clear 1080P, but it's good enough for video chats. Low-light performance is lacking.. The other reason I got a webcam was to use Siri because the Mac Mini doesn't have a microphone. I went into settings to enable Siri and Location Services so that Siri would be more productive and accurate. Hitting the Siri button caused the microphone icon to appear at the top of the screen, and Siri worked.. The C960 is a solid little webcam for the money that works fine with the Mac Mini M1 as long as you download the EMEETLINK software. I would not recommend this to anyone looking to do podcasts or YouTube videos. For that, use the iPhone and Continuity Camera feature built into the Mac, or get a higher-end 4k cam. But if you want a simple camera and microphone for the Mac Mini, this is a solid choice for the money.",4.0 out of 5 stars,/Webcam-Streaming-Recording-Built-Correction/dp/B07M6Y7355/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,"1080P Webcam with Microphone, C960 Web Camera, 2 Mics Streaming Webcam, 90¬∞View Computer Camera, Plug and Play USB Webcam for Online Calling/Conferencing, Zoom/Skype/Facetime/YouTube, Laptop/Desktop"
" September 12, 2023",Reviewed in the United States ,Zachary Bell,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Are you ready to elevate your video conferencing and content creation game? The EMEET C960 Webcam with Tripod has got you covered. I've been using this webcam for a while, and here's why I'm impressed:. **Video Quality (5/5):**. The C960 delivers stunning 1080p HD video quality. Whether you're hopping on a Zoom call, recording a YouTube video, or having a virtual family chat, the clarity is outstanding. It captures every detail, and the colors are vibrant and true-to-life.. **Audio Performance (4.5/5):**. Equipped with a built-in microphone, the audio quality is surprisingly clear for a webcam. While an external microphone might still be preferable for professional content creators, the C960's mic works perfectly for casual use and online meetings. Plus, it helps reduce background noise for better conversations.. **Privacy Cover (5/5):**. Privacy is a top concern, and the C960 addresses it with a nifty privacy cover. Slide it over the lens when you're not using the webcam, ensuring your privacy is protected. It's a simple yet effective feature that I appreciate.. **Adjustable Mini Tripod (4/5):**. The included mini tripod is a thoughtful addition. It's adjustable in height, allowing you to find the perfect angle for your video. While it's not the sturdiest tripod out there, it works well for desktop use.. **Plug & Play (5/5):**. Setting up the C960 is a breeze. Simply plug it into a USB port, and it's good to go. No need to install drivers or deal with complicated configurations. It's truly a ""plug and play"" experience.. **Compatibility (5/5):**. The C960 is compatible with a wide range of video conferencing and streaming apps, including Zoom, Skype, YouTube, FaceTime, and more. It seamlessly integrates with your favorite platforms.. In summary, the EMEET C960 Webcam with Tripod is a fantastic choice for anyone looking to upgrade their webcam experience.

When I tried, it would only show a line at the top and the rest was pixelated. it also did not work well with the extender cable i had. I would definitely recommend purchasing a long, high quality USB C to A cable and not using this camera with mobile devices that can't supply a lot of power through USB.. 3. The software with the camera is pretty bad. It doesn't have a lot of features, but it was not an issue for me since I use the camera with OBS and can do whatever I like with it..

This webcam + microphone is not for professional level video streaming.. If you need a webcam + mic device that is good enough, and performs better than most/all laptop integration webcams, then just buy this and call it a day. There are a lot of options, but I promise that unless you are a really particular human, you will be happy with this product.. a) WfH business person taking video calls for work = YES. b) private individual streaming to connect with friends/family = YES. c) a recreational streamer = YES. Detailed review notes below..... **MOST IMPORTANT THING TO KNOW**. The camera can only go so far, but a lot of what determines the final video quality is what YOU do to create a good video streaming environment. Read: If you are in a windowless cave 50' below Earth's surface with no artificial lighting, poor video quality is on you, not the device.. Lighting and distance of the camera from your face are THE MOST IMPORTANT VARIABLES in determining whether this camera performs well or not. I posted a photo of my specific camera placement and lighting and desk situation, and have tested out four different lighting scenarios (listed below) to show the impact of lighting on the video quality.. **REVIEW NOTES**. Each number 1-4 below has a matching image that I have attached to this review:. 1. Only natural light from my office windows (indirect sunlight). 2. #1 + clip-on desk lamp with warm colored LED. *MY FAVORITE SETUP* 3. #2 + recessed ceiling lights (3"" white colored LEDs with 8' ceilings). 4. Natural light from windows + recessed ceiling lights (NO desk lamp). *NOTE*: Each image was taken via Windows Snipit tool while waiting to join a Google Meeting. BOTTOM LINE, you have to mess around with your lighting and camera distance to get the sweet spot for. your specific environment, and may require additional lighting sources (e.g. lamp) to get it right.. The EMEET app is super easy to install and provides decent enough picture settings to tweak the image quality without being overkill. No login/account/signup required.

" October 25, 2009",Reviewed in the United States ,Daviangel,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is pretty much the book you would want to get if you are a mathematician or math student needing to write a C++ program.. It keeps things simple by sticking more of the error prone and complicated parts of C++ to the end. I guess you could see it as a cookbook approach to learning C++ since as the author states the main goal is ""... we are interested in getting data into our programs and results out of them"" and the book succeeds in this regard. It sticks to using call-by-reference and the STL container classes to cover alot more than other books that cover building container classes from scratch. All the examples are math oriented so you know it's intended for math types and would come in handy for any student taking math classes wanted to write programs to follow what they are doing in class. What I really liked is that it covers some things that other C++ don't cover at all like using Doxygen to documentation your code or creating your own makefiles. It also covers thing like using GNU Multiple Precision Library for arbitrary precision, the TNT and JAMA packages for linear algebra work, and GNU plotutils package for visualization work with your programs which I have yet to see any other introductory C++ books I've read. It's also platform agnostic so most if not all the examples should work on any computer you use be it Windows, Linux or Mac.",4.0 out of 5 stars,/C-Mathematicians-Introduction-Students-Professionals/dp/158488584X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,C++ for Mathematicians: An Introduction for Students and Professionals

It's obviously not appropriate for a future programmer, but for a mathematician who needs passing familiarity with programming it's perfect.

" July 10, 2023",Reviewed in the United States ,Dan Neuwirth,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow, this is a definite three steps up from the prior scanners I've had which were functions of an ""all-in-one"" printer/scanner: slow, clunky, page jams, babysitting the scanner. All those problems are in the past now that I have my new ScanSnap.. Scanner installation was easy: simply download the appropriate installation package from the Fujitsu (now Ricoh) web site, install the software and plug in the USB 3 cable to the scanner when instructed. The entire installation process including downloading the software took under 10 minutes.. Open the lid, the scanner connects and powers on in about 2 seconds and is ready for use.. Put your documents in face down and facing the rear, click the one big bright blue button (!) and zip zip zap your pages are ingested at a rate of about 40 pages per minute, EVEN double sided! Yep, scan a double-sided 40-page (80 impressions) document in 60 seconds! Natively saves to PDF so multi-page single files are no problem.. Software is a little clunky---it's kind of one of those ""does it all"" interfaces with a thousand options, but seems to miss some of the more obvious advanced settings that would be conducive to advanced users, like the ability to simply pop up a standard Windows system ""Save As"" box on completion (bypassing the ScanSnap Home interface), rather than the clunky software where I go in to type the new file name and then have to save it in there. It just adds a few unnecessary clicks, but isn't all that aggravating.. [EDIT: I've figured out how to scan to a folder with no pop-up interaction, which is great. Simply go into ScanSnap Home, and use the ""Show with File Explorer"" send-to option.]. This is NOT a TWAIN or WIA scanner so you can't just go into your existing generic scanner app and ""pull"" in a page--you must use ScanSnap BUT it provides all the basics (almost as defaults) for any document scanning any small office or business user would need and you can always edit the resultant PDF in Adobe or Word or whatever.. It's been an hour since I connected it. I've just scanned 15 years of personal and business tax returns, over 500 pages in total. I've literally digitized and removed a 3 inch thick stack of paper from a file drawer IN AN HOUR. And the ix1400 is just one of the more basic units in the ScanSnap line. They have units capable of scanning much faster and in larger volumes, but for the price this basic unit is likely all anyone but the most demanding users would need.. The only misfeeds are where the page was iffy to begin with--a curled lip, a tear, or the occasional staple I missed (gasp!). When those misfeeds happen, the software pauses, tells you what happened, allows you to remove the errant page and then KEEP SCANNING as if nothing happened! Amazing. I used to have to trash and restart the entire scan.. All this in compact desk unit that folds up to fit in what's barely 6x12"" of desk space.. Staring at my 3-foot tall stack of papers, contracts, receipts, and photos to scan, I have realized that I should have bought a ScanSnap YEARS ago. Where have you been all my life, my precious scanner?!?!. The only reason I gave ""accuracy"" 4* instead of 5* was that on occasion, I've noticed the resulting scan is slightly skewed--the originals are fine, but a tax return scanned about 3-degrees off. Internal software de-skewing functionality would have resolved the issue but that's not a thing on the ix1400. So you may get an occasional skew, which is not significant for just scanning and storing old documents.",5.0 out of 5 stars,/Fujitsu-ScanSnap-One-Touch-Document-Scanner/dp/B08PMPHKDV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,"ScanSnap iX1400 High-Speed Simple One-Touch Button Color Document, Photo & Receipt Scanner with Auto Document Feeder for Mac or PC, Black"

For the last couple of months we've been using a flatbed scanner to grab one at a time. That worked. But then I spoke with my dad, and he described a previous generation of this scanner that he found very handy.. I was very surprised to find how consistently it can go through a stack of pictures. The only two times it jammed were tiny sub-wallet-sized photos. Everything else Just Works. We're a few weeks in with this new scanner, so a few hundred pictures scanned, so far.. The one issue I have with the software is that it's a little inconsistent on guessing which way is up. I may have to turn that off and just arrange the pictures prior to scanning them. As it is, even if I arrange them ahead of time, about one out of every ten or fifteen will be rotated the wrong direction. I only ever grab 15 or fewer at a time, so I've gotten in the habit of scrolling through the pictures and rotating them prior to clicking the save button. It's not a huge issue. Just a bit annoying, if I forget to do that manual step.. The software is also another example of trying to help too much. I'm a geek, so I would like to just set the settings and then save those off. This software wants to divide things up by activity. Scan to File, Scan to Application, Scan Receipts, etc. It's mostly the same thing, but it's kind of backwards from how I think. It's working well enough. But, I usually find this sort of thing kind of annoying.. Unfortunately, it takes almost exactly as much time for me to walk her through renaming each picture as it did to scan them individually on the flatbed. She just can't keep track of where she is in the process, anymore.. I recommend this scanner. It's a little more expensive than I'd like, but it has been rock solid in performance, so far.

If it's the first time you've used a high speed duplex scanner you may be shocked. It rockets the sheets through there with such speed you think: Wait, really!? Is this possible? Is this real!?. I bought this for one simple reason: The one I had no longer had software that would work with Windows 11 and wasn't really supported on Windows 10 either.

This unit was very easy to set up and the software installed easily. Due to a death in the family, my family ended up having large volumes of paperwork from a variety of sources and being able to bring those up at a fingertip, while in the office of some professional, is really helpful and critical to keeping things moving quickly. I have another Scansnap unit -- the S1100, which is older, but still works quite well. It's great for travel, rather slow, and VERY slow compared to this model.

" January 21, 2022",Reviewed in the United States ,GracieLou731,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I had used the Fujitsu ScanSnap iX500 scanner for years. It got damaged and I had to replace it. I would have bought another iX500 as I loved it, but it is no longer available. After some research I purchased the iX1400. It's a good scanner, but does have a couple of problems.. I had a lot of problems downloading the software from the Fujitsu website. I don't think there's a way to use the scanner without downloading the software. Fujistu offers two different software options to use with the scanner, but they don't explain what the differences are between the two. In addition, the website has you going around in circles to find out more information about the downloads and where to find the downloads. To be honest, I can't tell you what software I actually got installed. I would try to download one version and it would fail, then I'd try another and it would fail. Then I'd try the first one again, and it would fail. And so on. I was about to box up the scanner and return it, but decided to try to download the software one more time, and after almost an hour I got one of the executables downloaded and the software installed.. Since purchasing this new scanner, I've scanned probably around 1000+ pages. The scanning speed is excellent and is comparable to my previous Fujitsu scanner. However, there are some problems with the software.. There is a configuration manager where in theory you can set defaults for scans. When I change many of the default settings, they don't get applied/saved. For example, when I change the default folder to save scans, the scanner ignores my changes. However, I can specify the folder after each scan. In addition, by default the scanner is supposed to include blank pages that you run through the scanner in the scanned output. But it ignores blank pages and omits them from output. And there are instances where I do want the blank pages included in my output.. In the Amazon description, it says that there is automatic rotation and de-skewing of pages. The scanner rotates pages whether you want them rotated or not. By default the configuration panel is set to rotate pages. There is a way to disable the page rotation setting in the configuration panel, however disabling the setting has no effect. There was a documentation set I was scanning where I didn't want pages rotated. I disabled page rotation in the configuration panel, but the pages were rotated anyway in the scanner output. And I find that it does not de-skew a lot of pages.. Other observations... this model comes with a really really short USB cable. Maybe 2ft? So depending on your set-up you may have to purchase a longer cable. Also, unlike my previous scanner, this one does not include a carrier sheet for scanning odd-sized and/or delicate documents and photos. So that's something that you'll have to purchase separately if needed.. A scanner like this is definitely the way to go if you have a lot of documents to scan as opposed to a flatbed scanner. I have to say, though, I'm not sure if I'd buy this scanner again, mostly due to my lousy experience downloading and using the software.",3.0 out of 5 stars,/Fujitsu-ScanSnap-One-Touch-Document-Scanner/dp/B08PMPHKDV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,"ScanSnap iX1400 High-Speed Simple One-Touch Button Color Document, Photo & Receipt Scanner with Auto Document Feeder for Mac or PC, Black"

The old one was still working and never broke. But even with drivers downloaded on new computer, some features would be missing. My old Scansnap is high quality built and I feel sad I'm giving up the old one just because it is not compatible with new computer. I noticed the new Scansnap ix1400 has some fancy new features my old one did not. It has a slightly curved up tray at the bottom to catch the papers once it scans. I do not use the wireless feature, so I am unable to comment on it. I rather use the USB connection. It rarely jams, but if it does, it's very easy to get the paper out. Overall I still love Fujitsu ScanSnaps. Very easy to use and it scans fast. I can put 20 pages at a time and it scans effortlessly.

" October 23, 2018",Reviewed in the United States ,cmath,4.0 out of 5 stars,"In recent years, I've used many Mac keyboards -- Apple, Logitech solar-powered, Logitech rechargeable, and several wired keyboards with a keypad. All of them sooner or later left me frustrated. Logitech's batteries wear down in a matter of months. The solar keyboard is no longer really available (except on the secondary market). And I just got tired of the ""your keyboard has died, change the batteries again"" routine.. Unfortunately I could never really find a suitable wired replacement, until I tried this keyboard. While it's not perfect, and it felt a little ""clacky"" when I first started using it, it is nevertheless the best solution if you don't want a full-sized keyboard with keypad crowding your desktop.. Pros:. * Wired (for me this is a plus) - no more batteries!. * Same approximate size, shape, and styling of Apple's official keyboard. * Performs reasonably as expected.. * No more wrestling with finicky wireless connections or batteries. * Price still seems high for machine-molded plastic and some minor electronics, but it's cheaper than competitors.. Cons:. * Feels a little cheap when you type at first... a little ""clickety-clackety"". * Keys and typing action are not as nice as Macally's larger keyboards. * There is a bright, unnecessary power light at the top of the keyboard. It's distracting, so I taped over it.. * Plastic feels sturdy, but cheap. Macally also makes a great, low-priced silent wired mouse that is also excellent. Overall I give this keyboard a positive rating because it's the best solution I've found to solve the ""stop using batteries"" problem. A better keyboard could still be made, but since Apple discontinued their wired products we are left to search for third party providers. All things considered Macally did a credible job of providing a replacement.",4.0 out of 5 stars,/Macally-Computer-Keyboard-Desktops-SLIMKEYC/dp/B0777GCK68/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,Macally USB Wired Keyboard for Mac and Windows PC - Plug and Play Apple Keyboard with 78 Scissor Switch Keys and 13 Shortcut Keys - Compact & Small Keyboard that Saves Spaces and Looks Great - White

" August 12, 2023",Reviewed in the United States ,Butch,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't like to post reviews for a product until I've had a good chance to use it for a while. So, now a review.. I like this router, it has decent range (I have to place my router in a less-than-optimal place). Day to day usage is good, I have only had one instance where I thought a reboot was necessary. Internal network and internet speed is good and consistent.. It supports DDNS via its own internal client (though I have to renew my DNS entry every 30 days-not Netgear's issue).. I like to have a few devices ""hard-coded"" to specific IP addresses, and the router supports this, although finding the section in the UI to actually do this is not as clear as I think it could be.. The router also supports ""port-range"" forwarding and triggering. My previous router could ONLY specify single ports for forwarding, which was very restrictive for some applications.. There is a ""guest mode"" supported, also.. What I really like about the router is the lack of disruption when changing most parameters. Some routers require a reboot for parameter changes to take effect. I do not recall this ever happening while changing settings on this router.. The router supports VPN, gaming applications, NTP servers, and internet access restrictions. Internet sites can be blocked by keyword, time, and service type.. Of course, the more common router features are fully supported as well.. I don't like buying a ""pig-in-a-poke"". Many router vendors do not provide their router manuals on their websites, which is a red flag to me. If I can't review the manual to determine suitability of a given product to my needs, then I prefer not to take a chance with my money. Netgear does an outstanding job of providing easy access to their manuals.

" May 28, 2023",Reviewed in the United States ,Debora Parker,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Though I have no quarrel with the quality of the NETGEAR Router; it actually works great with my new fiber install, but doesn't recognize my printer. However, there is one thing that I didn't consider before buying. In my attempt to save a few dollars in buying a pre-owned item, I didn't consider that the router's configuration might still have the previous owner's information.. When I attempted to log in to the router, I was prompted for the answers to two security questions which obviously the original owner had set and Amazon wouldn't have this information. I tried to reset the router to factory settings as indicated from the owner's manual that I found via an online search, but the only thing that was reset was the initial login/pwd to the router which luckily was on the router's label.. When I attempted to register the router on the NETGEAR website, I received the following message ""This serial number is already registered to another customer..."". I contacted NETGEAR Support via email for assistance. They responded with a request for information to substantiate my purchase from Amazon and a picture of the router showing the Serial Number. I complied as requested.. The response that was subsequently received read ""As we reviewed your Order Confirmation, it shows that the device purchased is a used unit. Please note that the NETGEAR warranty is valid for the original purchaser only and is not transferable."". I again replied that I am aware of the item being 'used' and am not concerned with the warranty; I only need to know how to be able to access the router and reset the security questions, then work with the configuration in order for it to recognize my peripheral devices--mainly my printer. The email thread contains a Support Case Number, so I am sure that the messages from me are being received by NETGEAR. Follow up emails from myself to NETGEAR Support have produced no responses..

" October 16, 2020",Reviewed in the United States ,DM Winslow,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Pathfinder Module Review Legacy of fire: Book 1 Howl of the Carrion King.. Intro:. Hello, I am DM Wnslow and this is going to my Review on the Pathfinder Adventure Path Module 1 of 6, Legacy of Fire Howl of the Carrion King.. This Adventure Module was released April, 22, 2009. The Adventure itself is written by Erik Mona, to me he is a famous for writing Burnt Offerings Book 1 for Rise of the Runelords, which is a piece of work that most Pathfinder Players might find themselves playing, as it‚Äôs the First Main Adventure Complete Path from Paizo back in August, 2007.. But we are not here to talk about Runelords yet, so let's start talking about Book One of Legacy of Fire, the Howl of the Carrion King.¬†. SPOILER WARNING:. SPOILERS if you're a player, you probably shouldn‚Äôt read this content as I may or definitely reveal major mechanics of the plot and story in this video. As I‚Äôve written this I won‚Äôt say anything that doesn't need to be said unless I‚Äôm changing it or make a critique and recommendation.¬†. Review:. From the forward section. That's Pages 1 through 5 in the book you learn that this content was planned before Runelords, and was initially going to include the Kingmaker Ruleset. But due to time, and real life events The Paizo Team put on the backburner and eventually completed it two years later.. With this said, I want you to know that when I ran my version of Legacy of Fire, I opted to include the Kingmaker Rule Set and Massive Battle Rules to enhance the gameplay of the story.¬†. You should always read the Adventure Module cover to cover before running your party's first session. I know sometimes this doesn't happen and a lot of DM‚Äôs get stuck eating the book,¬†. So if you read all of Book 1, you‚Äôll find that at the end of book 1 is a large downtime segment and it was a perfect segway for the Kingmaker Rules introduced in March 2010 in the Kingmaker Adventure Path, I however don‚Äôt recommend you use those, just go out and buy a copy of Ultimate Campaign it came out June 2013, it has an updated set of the rules from Kingmaker that function cleaner. I recommend using the Downtime rules for Book 1 and getting into the Mass Combat rules for Book 2 of the AP.. All of the Adventure Path is a pleasure to read, but they do introduce the Big Bad Villain early for the DM in the Book 1 Adventure Background and Summary, but very late for the Players, who won‚Äôt even glimpse his physical existence till the beginning of Book 3. So I recommend building some story telling mechanic or ‚Äúin‚Äù that is going to have the players maybe have an idea of who Jhuvhal is, but overall as a default you should assume any short live races don‚Äôt know him or the events that start the Legacy of Fire 500 years before.. I have to talk about the Ruleset, It is in Wizards of the Coast 3.5 D20 system from June, 2003. However this amazing person known as John Magrum converted most of it for you June 2010, its over on the Paizo Forums, search for keywords ‚Äúlegacy of fire 3.5 conversion paizo forums‚Äù. In October 2020 it was the top listing on Google. I used them, the conversions toughen the game up, it definitely needs it going from 3.5 to pathfinder 1.0.. For the Opening, I took the material given and gave a great introduction paragraph to me PC‚Äôs to set the tone and start the game. I started them in the Desert riding towards their destination as recommended by the campaign‚Äôs adventure.¬†. I‚Äôm my Game. We had a Goblin Rogue, Suli Cavalier, Human Gunslinger, Gnome Druid and Human Sorcerer.¬†. I really liked the idea of a War using Wishes introduced in the Adventure Background and decided to experiment in my campaign with what I coined an ‚Äúall star‚Äù pick for player characters. So I looked to people who I had played with many times, and told them if they choose to re-roll a previous character from a campaign, that they would have the memory of the previous campaign but they were effectively starting over at level one and starting this story. I encouraged them to ask, why were they level one again? And why were they on this mission? And why they couldn't remember how they got from being that person to be in the here and now of session 1. You might be looking at me and asking? But why? There is so much confusion and you aren't answering how all this work, and I have this thought for you, Imagine a Wish War so powerful that it changed the way time worked and now they are playing in a new part of the world and playing out a different story. You wan‚Äôt to avoid telling them this for as long as possible but this is a really cool mystery to instil in the opening moments of the game, the entire time the players are playing they‚Äôll be looking for an answer on why they are no longer the version of themselves they remember, and when you finally start cracking open a story about events that happened 500 years ago because of the Big Bad Villain it's really personalizes the story because how it has impacted them. In my game two characters were new characters and new players I had never played with, so they played fresh characters and the other three players brought back one character from our previous Rise of the Runelords Game and Two Characters brought characters from my friends Kingmaker‚Äôs game that I was present in.¬†. To continue, I really liked the intro that Eric Mona writes. It feels like a really great natural start. To Summarize it they literally start already traveling to point X, Intro the Characters, when we really have a good feel we move forward to the event that set us up for a great scenario of a ‚Äúwho done it?‚Äù I recommend you really dig into the characters that the book provides and try you best to flesh them all out as actually people, I feel like that with my initial playthrough and we ended up referencing those characters and going back to them to have more conversations over and over again even at the End of Book 1, and throughout Book 2 and Book 3. The Caravan that Eric provides serves the same function as a Good Tavern, and if you use find yourself creative there are a cast of no name guards you can breathe life into or you can even just add extra npcs to throw in more flavor or extra storylines you may want to add onn your own initiative. To mention the Detective Work, I recommend diving into that as well because you can really breathe life into who died and how what they were doing really sets a Foreshadowed tone for the game that I paid extra attention too. Eric also even gives you a in-depth enough mystery case that there is a chance for a false positive on the suspect. To wrap this up there is a lot of great info about these NPCs and what they know and can share with the party and I recommended you don't skip any details with this as some particular details can weigh down certain NPS and completely alter or impact that NPC destiny with the party for good and bad I felt.¬†. ¬†The Pugwampi‚Äôs introduced as the first real threat in the game are very unique to me, and I have never seen a creature that worked this way in all of my time of playing DND from a very young age and it was very new and fresh really upset the Older players in my game, which I was of course delighted by. I was extremely confused of a certain damsel in distress location and found the wording very confusing in a certain situation involving a goat,a rope and cactus and overall to this day I feel that opening scenario is written poorly and I had hard time understanding where the Goat, the Rope and the Cactus where actually located. Being that I‚Äôve written this much about it, you should assume I love this content and this is a small gripe in the larger work presented.. Don‚Äôt skip the Opening Dungeon, the Church of St.Vardishal is a true treat and has a lot of fun things for the party to play with, I recommend using it as a base of operations and stage for future scenes. The Ending of St.Vardishal was super important for my game, I am referring to A19. This particular creature I presented in a very overpowered fashion, making it very quick, almost making it immune initially just long enough to impose fear and horror of what it was. Once this obviously easy encounter is over the Consequences of it lasted throughout the entire campaign. This particular story element comes with what I will refer to as an inherited Template and is very unique to Legacy of Fire and was one of my favorite features. When The Character who inherited the Template in my game died, I referenced a popular movie ‚ÄúWeekend at Bernies‚Äù and allowed the dead PC to build a new character but it would be from the flesh of the Dead Template character, this caused Fungus to spread to the entire dead body and reanimate it and slowly become a walking Fungus Man named St. Vardishal, overall allowing my PC‚Äôs to have a walking talking member of the Templar of the Five Winds to be in the campaign for a good chunk of the story we played.¬†. Now that we started really talking about some spoiler elements I want to mention the Templar of the Five Winds in particularly. Nefeshti, I used her a motivating force for two of my PC‚Äôs as sort of Employer/Boss who sends them to find the Scroll of Kakishon this gave these two pc‚Äôs a little background on the story and automatically sets them up to want to do one of two things when they find the Mcguffin later in¬† Book 3. She can be the All Powerful Wizard who saves the party if you ever lose control and you are about to have a really bad TPK and you can‚Äôt figure out what to do, it could also be a great way to motivate the PC‚Äôs if they ever go of course. And when all else fails you can simply say the ‚ÄúWizard did it.‚Äù But I don‚Äôt recommend using this more than once for the entire campaign and do it early to establish that relationship and then keep her faraway to allow player agency almost neglectfully so.. Part Three of Book 1 is the Real Sweet spot of the Game, the PC‚Äôs have an HQ by this time and are now an open world exploring the land around the city. After the Fire in Part 1 the PC‚Äôs are told they have to Retake a City Occupied by Gnolls. At this point you really hit player Agency as they get to explore, find all the pieces, and see how they can put all the pieces together to make something unique and fun every time. In my play through I really dragged it out enough so that my PC‚Äôs had explored almost everything 100% outside the city before attempting to go inside the Upper half of Kelmerance and this allowed them to come up with a plan using the games elements introduced. In my playthrough my PC‚Äôs decided to work with some other Gnolls not friendly to the Gnolls inside the City of Kelmerance, having killed some gnolls and stashed there body in shallow graves in the desert, when it came time to plan the heist, they simply put the dead guard uniforms on the friendly Gnolls and attempted a Trojan Horse play that was amazing to be apart of as a DM.. Let‚Äôs talk about Kelmerance, I didn't play it as a straight through Dungeon but it's definitely designed that way if you want to do it. I presented it as a Living, breathing, Gnoll city where half if it was in ruins and you could easily sneak into the lower city, but getting into the Upper City was nearly impossible without climbing, fighting, or some sort of Trick or Plan. This allowed the PC‚Äôs enough to play to meet some friendly NPCs in the lower city and really gave the city more depth than just a place to smash through. ¬† When it came time for them to sneak into the Boss Room and fight the Big Bad Guy I did some things, One its turns out the Big Bad Guy is demon possessed Father to one of the PC‚Äôs and two I put The Powerful Flind Lieutenant Ugruk and The Harpy Undrella in the same room as the Boss to back him up. This caused half the party to walk over the ledge towards the Harpy, causing a Defeat. Yes I said Defeat, I had a Sorta TPK in Book One that I avoided with Story! Our Luke SKywalker Suli, having been defeated by Dad in her final moments, tries to reach out to her father deep inside, who comes to his senses just long enough to send her compatriots to the dungeon. At this point of the Game I have A Goblin Rogue, Gnome Druid who fled and is now back at an Empty HQ, because everyone was in the Trojan Horse and thus in Prison this includes your opening cast from the Fire Scenes! Back inside Kelmerance we‚Äôve got the Supporting Cast, One Alive PC and one dead PC who happens to be the Moldspeakr and the PC is rebuilding his own version of a Fungus man St. Vardishal. The Dead Guards, knowing the PC is dead, take them out of the prison cell and throw in a Coprise pile pit located at H13 which causes the New Fungusman to run around Kelmerance and try to help. I used the Battlemarket plus Gladiator idea to have my prisoners fight in Battlemarket fights as entertainment while imprisoned, this gives you a chance to introduce the conflict between Hallen and ‚ÄúThe Strangler‚Äù some interesting characters in Kardswanns court. Also don't‚Äô forget of Undrella The Harpy who is actually playing an abused girlfriend role, she can play an important ally in Defeating Kardswann, and it's also critical that she not be around to use her Harpy powers in the Rematch, or the party is going to have a hard encounter on their hands.¬† In the end, Me and My Pc‚Äôs end up Orchestrating a Re-Entry to the Upper City, A prison break and one big final showdown, with Big Bad Daddy. Some really great moments were captured and it's not over there once Almah, your boss really tells you why you're in town. In my Playthrough we didn‚Äôt suffer any additional Deaths in Book 1 other than the Fight with Kardswann who is a really nasty character. After you deal with the Bonus Boss, The Demon who was possessing Kardswann. My PC‚Äôs chose to spare Kardswann and welcome him into the party. By the End of Book 1 We have Two Templates of the Five Winds hanging out with the PC‚Äôs. This gave me a chance to sit the Pc‚Äôs down and really tell them about what happens aka the Events that transpired between Nefesti and Javhul, I‚Äôm referring to the Story Details located on Page 8-9 in Book 1. At the end Eric Mona makes some One Year Downtime Suggestions and this is where I worked in my Kingmakers rules that I talked about, Almah will ask the party to stay and work on the town and become invested in its reconstruction which is the Second Sweat spot of the Campaign.¬†. Here is where I'm going to get more Critical, where Book 2 Starts is not In my opinion the Next Logical step of the story and I Implore you to slow down a little bit and really try to build some true RPG Tabletop by letting the players really take Agency and do what they want to do. Eventually they will stop doing things and will wait for something to Happen. Then that's when you start Book 2!. The Book has more material, after the Module concludes there is a few pages about the Gnolls of Brazen Peaks by Ercic Haddock, while this is Amazing Content none of it was really useful in Book 1 and I found myself coming back to this chapter when planning and running Book 2. The material here is really good and referenced it a lot when coming up with Armies of Gnolls to fight in Book 2.¬†. The Set Piece: Refuge of Nethys is a wonderful little relic to investigate out in the desert hills,, My Pc‚Äôs never found the hidden entrance to Part 2 and completely avoided the Lycanthrope Storyline which I was super disappointed by. I tried to introduce it again later in Book 3 but it never played out.¬†. The little writing pieces they include in Adventure Modules are actually fun to read and usually have hidden details about Katapesh that you can gleam and even include in your roleplaying, Elaine Cunningham‚Äôs Dark Tapestry is no exclusion.. The Bestiary has a piece that dives into the Pugwampis and other Gremlins, its got your Stat Block for the Peryton fight, and a Div I never worked out a way to introduce. The Book then wraps up with an outline of all 6 books for the Legacy of Fire.¬†. Conclusion:. Overall, I really Loved this Book and it was a very strong Start for Legacy of Fire. And was a Delight to run from start to finish. I recommend not rushing in as you can really bite off more than you can chew if you Railroad . Letting the PC‚Äôs breath and really taking their time to ferment a plan to retake Kelmerane can really be the magic key to a great Tabletop Game.¬†. Second Playthrough:. If I ever did anything different I would try to make it less obvious that Kardswann is possessed to ensure his death at the PC‚Äôs hands, having him Alive in Book 2 took away player agency when it came to make a decision about the McGuffin in Book 3.

" February 3, 2011",Reviewed in the United States ,Mathew,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a solid adventure for low level characters. The players are employed by a merchant princess to help return her family to a position of power. The adventure requires the players to conduct investigations, to interact with NPC's and form long term relationships with those NPC's, and (of course) to kill the bad guys. There are elements of humor throughout the adventure and there are (most importantly to me) lots of opportunities to role play. You don't have to hack and slash. In fact, players without a plan will most likely meet their doom. The ""monsters"" often offer players alliances and choices. As the players liberate an old monastery and liberate a ruined town they find it harder and harder to figure out who the ""bad guys"" actually are. Players have to make many alignment based decisions. The adventure works well for characters that are good, evil, or somewhere in between.. The product quality is excellent. Lots of color illustrations. The adventure takes up about 50 pages. The remaining 35 pages include background information about the tribal gnolls of the region, a short side quest, bestiary, and part 1 of a continuing short story (you get one installment per adventure).. There are a few typos and one map is quite unclear about how you access the third level of a bazaar. A good adventure with an arabian feel. I have played role playing games for 30+ years.

The module itself is very good but has an unfortunate number of typos and inconsistencies. Prepared GMs shouldn't have any problems overcoming the problems caused by this because the intent of the module designer is quite clear throughout the adventure.. The basic plot is that an agent of the mysterious Pactmasters has taken the unusual step of hiring a group of novice adventurers (some of whom might be slaves) for a situation that appears to be far more than they can cope with. It will not be a surprise to the reader that things are not as they seem.. I've nearly finished the module with a group of adventurers and they have been tested to the limits by the encounters.

" February 13, 2012",Reviewed in the United States ,Chris,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is probably the best first-level module, and first Adventure Path installment, that I've run. I loved it, the players loved it, they still talk about it today.. The characters are hired to meet up with a trade caravan and reclaim an Arabesque city from gnolls, in order to restore it to a functioning trade hub; while the path goes to bigger and greater things later, here, it's low-level town reclamation and gnoll slaying. In fact, the module is kind of a low-level guerrilla assault on the gnoll-occupied village, where the players have the freedom to choose how and where they strike. Likewise, there's a lot of room for gnoll counter-attacks, or an assault on the PCs' monastery base.. And not just gnolls; there's a great variety of monsters at play, leading to some interesting and memorable combats. Best of all was the introduction of some gremlins as introductory villains. These little guys are pushovers stat-wise, but exude an aura of unluck which makes them really tough to deal with. Plus, they have a habit of hiding out in areas that have dangerous terrain features---cactus patches, for one---that has great synergy with their aura.. Granted, there's a lot more than just killin'. There's a lot of places to explore, including some interesting adventure seeds, and a set-piece mini-dungeon later in this book. The module introduces a batch of NPCs with the caravan, with plenty of opportunities to roleplay; on top of this, there's options for several of the ""bad guys"" to be talked/bribed into the PCs' side. And there's several locations, including the entire town, for the PCs to reclaim and occupy.. All in all, a very memorable module with a lot of grit and detail. The enemies are challenging without being overpowered, the setting is great---the art design in these books is simply stunning---and the plot is interesting and engaging. Add in the standard Path features---a bestiary, an overview of the gnoll tribes in the area---and you have a lot to work with adventure-wise. I highly recommend this Path; even alone this module is worth it.",5.0 out of 5 stars,/Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-Legacy-Carrion/dp/1601251599/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,"Legacy of Fire: Howl of the Carrion King (Pathfinder: Adventure Path, 19)"

" November 24, 2022",Reviewed in the United States ,Unhappy Consumer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using this for a month, here are my thoughts.. The set up is super easy. The network found the device and set it up and ready to use in no time. Adding users was easy and setting them up is easy. Moving photos and backing them up is also easy. Backing up from other cloud services (google) was simple too.. The USB in the back of the device is used to backup any USB device you plug into it.. The software on mobile device is much better than the desktop (which there really is none). The desktop is really a web portal with even more limited options. Example, on the windows 11 desktop (web portal) I cannot find where to remove a share. On Android I was able to remove a share. The mobile app for Android and iOS is below good but above terrible. It is difficult to organize your photos. Say you have duplicate photos, one from your mobile device and one from Google because you sync both and want to delete the Google version, it is not that easy especially if it is an older photo, like back in 2017. This is because you can go to photos and see 2 exact pictures or video and to find the Google version you need to open each photo and go to info. You can then delete the Google version. If you have several hundred this will take a while. You can go to Google folder but to get to 2017 from 2022 and you can have 1000s of photos, it will take a long time to scroll as there is not date selection at the folder level.. The search is virtually useless especially if your used to Google photo search.. In summary, it does the back up but hard to organize. Just think of a box of photos and as you take a pic it get thrown into a box. When you want to find a photo you can dig thru the box and know that the photos was thrown in there on top of each other so the further down the box you go the older the photo..

" June 3, 2021",Reviewed in the United States ,Straight Forward Review,4.0 out of 5 stars,"First off others' concerns and complaints are valid; this device has severely limited networkability, restricted access without internet, very limited configuration options, and poorly thought out and implemented features. It is geared toward consumers who are likely not technically-inclined and just want larger storage to replace or compliment online cloud services. ""Integration"" with my Windows 10 desktop is limited to the app being able to ""map"" a single personal folder to a drive letter. I can access a single public smb shared folder through the device's local ip address but that folder is not accessible remotely in the cloud, and any private user folders are not accessible in normal windows networking. So far notwithstanding everything I've tried the ""included(downloadable)"" WD Backup App doesn't see the device and I have found no way through the WD Discovery App to sync or backup anything on my desktop with the device. My experience with WD Android Apps make me believe backing up from my phone would be much more functional. I can add users if they have email addresses and internet access but I will have zero control or oversight in what or how much they store.. Initial setup was very very simple but I quickly found a long list of limitations.. With so many things to complain about, why 4 stars? First it uses WD Red drives. Build quality seems good. It just works, with minimal technical knowledge required. As close to plug-and-play as I'd expect something like this to be. Uses the online WD website as a gateway which is much better than punching holes through my router's security. Attractive and easy to use web interface. Good price because mine was one that was used. I took one star away because I really wanted it to be able to automatically sync a few folders from my desktop.. A few uncategorized comments: Device only has Raid 1 (mirrored/half tb capacity) or what they call JBOD which is more like internally spanned drive configuration, possibly a Raid 0 type setup, but who knows. Switching requires a complete wipe of stored files. Can backup Google Drive if I allow WD App/Device access to my Google Account. Can share files with links for other people to access over internet. Cannot automatically sync local files from desktop pc. Use router DHCP to assign specific local IP if access to Public folder is desired.

" February 9, 2021",Reviewed in the United States ,Saintsea,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the 8 TB My Cloud Home specifically to use as a Plex Media Server. I have been using the Plex server on an old laptop and really liked the way Plex organizes and serves up my photos, music, and video files on my network. But the old laptop is getting, well, older and will soon be an antique! The My Cloud Home seemed like a great and elegant solution to run Plex and I could use it for other cloud storage applications as well.. The My Cloud home was delivered quickly by Amazon, and setup was extremely simple. I've read some user reviews that complained that you had to have the WD Discovery app open to access the drive, and that just wasn't the case for me after initial setup. It connects to an ethernet RJ45 plug on your router to access the internet and becomes a ""cloud"" drive. After setup, the drive showed up as a network resource with a drive letter, and was super simple to manage within Windows 10. Some reviewers have noted that it was hard to create your own folders, and this too proved to be mistaken. I setup my folders just like I wanted and started to transfer files. What those reviewers got right was how LONG it takes to upload your content. I was getting about 10-13 MB/sec during transfer, nothing like typical USB 3.0 speeds. The My Cloud Home has a USB port in it for file uploads, but the speeds were still very slow.. After 2 days of uploading my media, I was ready to install Plex and see just how wonderful the new system would be. Plex is installed as a WD app through their online dashboard rather than directly from Plex. I had to install it twice to get it up and running, but once installed, it started to recognize and sort my media, and bringing in the descriptions and artwork for each item. Then I fired up Plex on my Roku and started to test everything out. My connection is on a fast 802.11ac wireless with great signal strength. Photos came up instantly and I was able to cycle through them with ease. Next, I tried the music files and they played perfectly as well. With great anticipation, I started a 720p movie...and the on screen status froze at 13%. I let the My Cloud Home crunch on it for a couple of minutes, then noticed it had gone offline and was restarting itself. Hmm. I made some configuration changes as recommended in the Plex forums, and the movie finally played, but the playback would stutter and jump, skipping about 30 seconds with each jump. It was unwatchable. I tried a different HD movie and got the same results, if I could even get the movie to play at all. Next I tried an 480p SD movie, and it played just fine. In fact, all of my SD content played fine, but the higher resolutions like 720p or 1080p would not (I didn't have any 4K to try).. After trying to find a solution and troubleshooting for a week, checking my router, setting up a static IP, making sure the firmware was up to date, etc. nothing seemed to work. Finally, I reinstalled by old laptop again just to see if something had failed in my network. Lo and behold, everything worked fine again! My conclusion from all this trial and error is that the My Cloud Home just doesn't have enough processing horsepower to transcode higher-def videos, at least when compared to an 8 year old laptop. Since my goal was to replace the laptop as a Plex server, it just didn't do what the WD description says it will do. I really wanted to like the My Cloud Home and it offered functionality beyond Plex that was pretty interesting to me. But in the end, it just didn't live up to its promise, thus I reluctantly had to send it back.. I might try a different Plex server option in the future, like a Synology drive or try one of those small NUC computers, but for now the old Dell is still working fine. If you need a solution for cloud storage, easy backups, and the ability to access and share files remotely, then the My Cloud Home could be a great value for you. But as a Plex Media Server, I just can't recommend it.

" November 9, 2022",Reviewed in the United States ,Ryan,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Update: At the time of writing this update MyCloud has been down for an entire week making it impossible to get to my files until they just recently offered a local storage work around. The work around is just mapping the device, which should have been an option from the get-go. Not to mention they are discontinuing support for the OS on this device in June, making it a useless hunk of junk and I didn't even own it for a year. I really regret this purchase.. I've been wanting a NAS for my home for a little while now, I've been looking at different options from building my own, Synology, QNAP, and WD. I don't plan to have plex or anything special, I just want storage attached to my network so my wife and I can have a single place to store everything.. Although the competitors have compelling options, I ultimately opted for this (the cheapest of those being considered) because it seemed to be the simplest. All I wanted was to create a partition for me, one for my wife, and sync our most important files with OneDrive. I read that this has a OneDrive app and it seemed simple.. The first disappointment was not being a able create a partition. When you add another user they get a login, and whatever they upload is private to them unless put into the shared family folder. Fine, it doesn't tickle my need to be a geek, but it's ""fine"".. The second disappointment was that OneDrive support was dropped in May 2022. I got into the sync app and connect OneDrive, it told me I would be notified when the sync was done. After a bit of time nothing was sync'd, so I dug a bit and discovered OneDrive support was dropped. I thought I'd work around that by placing my OneDrive folder on the network drive, but OneDrive prevents that. So I cannot keep a physical copy of my OneDrive docs on this drive.. Third I am not a big fan of having to use WD to login to my own physical device, nor am I a fan of having to use their application to map the drive in Windows. That's a little ridiculous, but I understand for the target audience (not tech savvy) that's probably very useful.. Finally, it's just a bit basic and boring. That's subjective, and maybe hypocritical of me since I wanted something basic attached to my network to save my files to. This is exactly that. For some people all they want is something basic, I understand not everybody wants to geek out and for them this product is great. I just feel like there should be more to it, or maybe less (not having to use their software). I'll keep it for now and update this review after a few months. I will likely end up doing some sort of two or four bay NAS setup from Synology or QNAP later on though. Maybe I will even reconsider the WD My Cloud EX NAS - although this experience doesn't inspire confidence in that product.",2.0 out of 5 stars,/12TB-Cloud-Personal-Storage-WDBMUT0120JWT-NESN/dp/B076DMH4R4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,WD 12TB My Cloud Home Duo Personal Cloud Storage - WDBMUT0120JWT-NESN

Since I am not sending my unit off with my data in it, I tried to salvage the two drives full of data. WD stores the RAID data in an almost unrecoverable format, so I lost the data. I did gain two working hard drives out of the failure however. With this said, the WD Home Cloud systems are great for home storage and should almost always be recoverable if a usual type problem happens. I bought a single and another double (duo). The way they move data is almost bulletproof and not subject to transfer failures as with many systems. With the way they are securely accessed, you have all your data and photos with you on your mobile devices anywhere you go. I think every home and small office would benefit from owning one.

The software when it runs is slow, there is no wifi, and it is a shingled drive. I never even got it filled like 2/3 maybe. But any time something had to be re written it was like usb2 slow. The software doesn't work in Linux period,,, you have to use the web interphase which some how manages to be 3x slower than the already slow wd driver for windows, android, and apple. For some reason it uses a proprietary protocol so SMB is shot, does not work. It will set up a slow plex server. the 8tb model does ok on simple formats, but MKV format video makes it chug to where I usually move the file rather than stream.

There are some online tutorials available. Just installing and enabling the Plex Server is not enough you must also enable DLNA before your TV will see the server.

" May 8, 2021",Reviewed in the United States ,Marcywm42,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased a WD My Cloud Home Duo (16 TB) because I was looking for an easy to share files with family members on my local network, and also be able to access these files while away from home via a mobile app. After reading several reviews of network attached storage (NAS) devices, I settled on the WD My Cloud Home Duo because it was highly rated by several tech review websites for its ease of use, and I have purchased several WD hard drives and external storage devices in the past.. Unfortunately, I was immediately disappointed because sharing files between users on the same network is much more cumbersome than described. First, everyone has to make a mycloud.com account. Then, the device owner needs to create a folder specifically for file-sharing, and then invite everyone to access this folder. And finally, the kicker is that these users cannot access this shared folder via Windows explorer - it must be accessed through the mycloud.com in-browser app, or it appears mounted as a separate network drive than the My Cloud Home Duo. The My Cloud Home Duo gets mounted as a Z: drive, and the shared folder gets mounted as a Y: drive. All I wanted was a shared network location for my household to dump some files, and instead I got a much more limited version of Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive, which completely defeats its purpose. And having the shared folder appear as a separate network drive is a very clunky and inconvenient experience.. I do not recommend this device to anyone. I browsed through the WD community forums and found that there was an easy to share files on your local network - there apparently used to be a 'Family' folder accessible to all network users that could be viewed like a normal folder in Windows Explorer, but for some reason WD removed this feature in 2019 software update and never restored it, despite outrage from the community. Instead, either get a true NAS device or pay for cloud storage. The WD My Cloud Home Duo tries to find some weird middle ground and instead fails to do either.",1.0 out of 5 stars,/12TB-Cloud-Personal-Storage-WDBMUT0120JWT-NESN/dp/B076DMH4R4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,WD 12TB My Cloud Home Duo Personal Cloud Storage - WDBMUT0120JWT-NESN
" October 7, 2018",Reviewed in the United States ,Daniel Rose,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall, this was pretty easy to set up and use. The only glitch was I had an older My Cloud drive and during setup of the My Cloud Home device, it asks if you have a previous My Cloud account which I had. If you try to login, you will not be able to input the new device activation code. After calling WD, it's because you need to register a new My Cloud HOME account. So there are separate My Cloud Home and My Cloud accounts. I wish they would clarify this during setup as it would have saved me 30 minutes trying to login.. Also, just be aware that 16TB is available, but really it is 8TB in a RAID 1 configuration. I guess you can switch to a RAID 0 somehow to get a full 16TB, but I did not see that option in setup, as it defaults to a RAID 1. I wanted a RAID 1 anyways so this was not a problem for me.. The USB ports are on the back which is an inconvenience. And you can only use 1 USB port at time, so why have 2?. EDIT Update: I had to RMA this after about 18 months - it sounds like one of the hard drives is failing making a loud whirring noise. WD is replacing the unit under warranty which is fine, but 18 months on a NAS hard drive is pretty short. I'm looking to eventually replace this with a NAS 4-disk storage unit. Also, having to load my old data on the new unit is extremely slow! For transferring large files, speeds of 17 mb/sec are fine. But smaller files like pics slows the speed to 3 mb/sec or less. Transferring 3.5 TB is taking about 3-4 days. And forget using the USB to transfer unit to unit.

The set up is quite simple, and WD packed a lot of features into this unit. However, they have so many variations of this product that their documentation is very generic as they tried to address a number of products with a generic set of instructions. Furthermore, the desktop app comes with apps that do not work for the y Cloud Home devices. Why would anyone release apps that are not intended to be used with this mode is beyond me.. Other than that, the sync process works well, and it works seamless with both Windows and Apple native backup software. Having a RAIDed system makes me feel at ease knowing that I have redundancy built in.If you are a beginner user or if you want ease of set up and simplicity, this is definitely the device for you.

" March 25, 2019",Reviewed in the United States ,Or A,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First, I like my new saw. All the comments about the weight, features and how good this saw is, I agree with. But let me add one note that came as a surprise to me.. I purchased this saw after using a friend's cordless DeWalt. As soon as I had my first hands-on experience with a circular saw with an electric brake I was sold! What a marvelous feature for a hand held power saw. My old Porter Cable had recently been stolen so I was in the market for a new saw and this was going to be my choice. But I did not want a cordless. I do not use a circular saw every day, not even every month, and I know batteries require pampering that they would not get from me. So I ordered the corded saw. I immediately tested it out for the one feature that so impressed me and to my disappointment it did not work. I called DeWalt and after a discussion about the brake not working for me, I was advised to return it for a replacement. Everyone was kind and understanding about my dismay and I received the replacement saw...but SAME RESULTS. The electric brake did not work.. Now I need to explain my frustration. My friend's cordless saw had the electric brake feature and when I used his saw it would stop on a dime. Seriously, pull the trigger to power up that saw and let it go and the blade stops immediately. So this time, instead of calling DeWalt, I called a service center for DeWalt. It turns out that there is a difference between an electric and a cordless saw due to the nature of the two products. The electric saw cannot be engineered to stop like the cordless. That said, I apologize to the seller and Amazon for putting them to the trouble of replacing a perfectly good saw.. I still like my new saw, but it might be wise to explain this detail to buyers who don't know this about the electric brake. And on a side note: I really think the saw (electric or cordless) should be packaged with the side guide. It just makes sense that this little attachment should be included with any circular saw. The old Porter Cable that I inherited from my Grandfather had one and he bought it back in the 50's. I guess things have changed.",5.0 out of 5 stars,/DEWALT-DWE575SB-Lightweight-Circular-Electric/dp/B007QUZ16A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,"DEWALT Circular Saw, 15 Amp, 57 Degree Bevel, Electric Brake, Corded (DWE575SB)"
" February 22, 2021",Reviewed in the United States ,Trueblue702,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It has been at least 50 years since I bought a circular saw. I make furniture, so I do not use a circular saw often. My 50 year old Craftsman is still going strong, but I needed a saw to dedicate to a track system and the manufacturer recommended the Makita and the Dewalt. I chose the Dewalt because of the electric brake. When I first took it out of the box, I was concerned by the light weight. It did not feel substantial. Once I used it, however, I knew it is a quality tool. I installed a 40 tooth Dewalt finish quality thin kerf blade, just like the one I have on my Craftsman. I have used lots of other people's circular saws over the years, but never anything that runs so smooth. Unlike other reviewers, I am getting no wobble whatsoever. It works great with a TrueTrac system and the light weight certainly diminishes fatigue. The brake operates as promised; I am still surprised when the blade comes to a stop so quickly. I can certainly recommend this saw to anyone who uses a circular saw occasionally as I do. It feels substantial enough for a professional as well, but I cannot attest to that.",5.0 out of 5 stars,/DEWALT-DWE575SB-Lightweight-Circular-Electric/dp/B007QUZ16A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,"DEWALT Circular Saw, 15 Amp, 57 Degree Bevel, Electric Brake, Corded (DWE575SB)"
" August 14, 2013",Reviewed in the United States ,Alabama Chef and Woodworker,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had several circular saws, all 7 1/4 except for a Dewalt 8 1/4 some years back. I purchased this saw because I wanted an electric brake to stop the blade faster. I believe that is a verrrry good safety feature and saves time over the long run. This saw is very sturdy, very well balanced, very powerful, excellent shoe plate, and various access levers to make needed adjustments. It is also, noticeably quieter than my previous saw. It also has an extra long cord, which is verrrrrrrry nice....It is smaller than I thought it would be, but that makes it compact and as, I said, above, very well balanced. The only thing it does not have is a safety lock on the switch. Most of the saws I have had have had that device, and while it is something extra to actuate, it also protects against accidental activation of the switch. Now, there must be a reason that Dewalt chose to do it this way. Its not a major item, as it just takes some getting use to. I have had times when the safety device on other saws was somewhat of a hinder, actually, because, at times, I was in an awkward position and unlocking the safety lock and activating the switch at the same time was a bit difficult. That is not often, but it can happen. Whatever the case, I am extremely pleased with the saw. I do all my work from a wheel chair, so the lighter weight helps as I do not have the physical strength I once had. All in all, this is a 5 star saw and I do not give out 5 stars in hardly any of these reviews. So, if you are looking for a very solid, well balanced, saw with all the trimmings, this one would be a very fine choice. It does cost more than a simple circular saw, but I believe it is worth it, especially in view of the quality and electric brake.

" August 28, 2018",Reviewed in the United States ,Orlando Reyes,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a very useful saw. I‚Äôve been running Makita‚Äôs 500 series circular saws since 1996 and they are hard to beat, but they get heavy over a day‚Äôs time. After running the Makita for so long, I‚Äôve developed some severe wrist fatigue and shooting pain when I try to grip simple things, usually after hours and I‚Äôve had a long day on the saw. I applaud you worm drive guys! Makita makes a nice little light 10 amp saw that I fell in love with at first, but after about 6 months, found out the thing just isn‚Äôt for the residential renno scene. It just can‚Äôt hold up to the abuse, plus, if you are doing any type of carpentry for a living, you know you need a saw with a max depth of cut, one that will go well beyond a forty-five degree bevel, and one that can withstand the rigorous environment.. This Dewalt saw is light, sturdy, and has all the bells and whistles I need to complete my task. Also, I really LOVE the guard on this saw, no need to pin it back for those compound cuts. The spring on the guard is just right, it does not interfere with your cutting at all. Another feature I admire on this saw is the brake, sweet! Granted I‚Äôve only had the saw for a few weeks, but this is a great product and is much lighter than the Makita saws I‚Äôve used for years. No more wrist pain after a long day of butchering wood! As for the guys that claim the table isn‚Äôt square with the blade, mine was square both ways right out of the box.

" June 12, 2016",Reviewed in the United States ,chris,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a nicer saw package than described (see images too). Most everything else has been discussed (power, accuracy, durability, etc) except the below.. THE BAG - It is much nicer bag than most would expect. Made of durable materials for the handles and such, it has a canvas wrapped hard metal rim around the entire top that hinges open and closed (like an old doctor medicine bag). It has long rubber feet on the bottom to limit wear and tear. Also has 3 pockets on the outside. Although it has a bottom piece, it feels like thin cardboard. So I'm going to insert a piece of 1/4"" x 14.5"" x 8.5"" soft maple inside the bottom and fasten this wood to the external rubber feet. This will keep the saw and canvas from ever making contact with hard ground and/or concrete. Although I like the plastic cases for tools, they can be a bit frustrating for me at times.. BLADE CRADLE - The kit comes with a plastic blade cradle that will hold 4-5 blades. It includes a spring clip retainer to hold the blades securely in the cradle. This protect them from damaging the saw or bag when storing blades in the bag.. 90¬∞ FINE TUNING - There is an adjustable allen set screw that allows you to set the blade at exactly at 90¬∞ using a square. Although most c-saws have this feature, Dewalt doesn't mention it anywhere except the manual. This is the ""stop"" that returns the saw to exactly 90¬∞ after using the normal lever controlled bevel adjustment. This ""fine tuning"" should be done when you first get the saw and whenever you install a new blade.

If you want to use one fan slot you can use velcro to attach the drives in a sort of ""floating"" mount but that doesn't really help reduce vibration. The other two fans are generally blocked depending on where your Motherboard sits. In my case the power supply connectors blocked the two additional fans.. In addition, two SSDs are supported via the front panel mounts however attempting to use these can be very difficult since there's not a lot of space between the mount and the fan slots in the front. So you end up hitting the fans with connectors.. The ""fan controller"" in the case built in is very small and probably should just get a better quality one yourself..

" October 23, 2023",Reviewed in Germany ,Felix H.,Was missing rubber feet. Manufacturer is 'unable' to help,"While the general build quality is good and the form factor is nice, this case has some design flaws regarding the HDD mounts which makes it rather difficult to use for a NAS with more than 6 HDDs. The clearance on the connector side of the HDDs in the HDD mount that's installed right above the ATX power supply is rather limited, so it's non-trivial to install more than 2 HDDs in one of the two 4 slot HDD mounts. The other HDD mount has enough clearance. Also the HDD mounts don't latch in place when installed and will slide out of the rails when you forget to put in the two screws and tilt the case to plug in the SATA cables on the mainboard side. Sure, this was part user error, but also part design flaw. Due to the lack of a SATA backplane the HDDs are plugged into, you'll also need to be careful that the SATA power cables don't cause the thin PCB of the 16TB Toshiba HDDs to flex too much. This is especially an issue when trying to install 4 HDDs above the power supply and the SATA power connectors of the power supply don't have the exact spacing between connectors that is needed. Also installing larger HDDs that require the additional brackets on the sides into the HDD mounts is a bit annoying; if you're used to server-grade cases with hot-swap HDD trays, you'll be disappointed by this case's HDD mounts. So for anyone intending to build a larger NAS, I'd recommend getting a case that has a SATA backplane and proper trays for each HDD instead.",3.0 out of 5 stars,/Fractal-Design-Node-Case-Computer/dp/B00JBBH93K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,Fractal Design Node 804 - Black - Cube Compact Computer Case - mATX - High Airflow - Modular Interior - 3X Fractal Design Silent R2 120mm Fans Included - USB 3.0 -Window Side Panel

" January 1, 2020",Reviewed in the United States ,Jeffrey S.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I previously had 16gb (2x8gb) sticks of 2666 ram. I bought them when they cost $160. 3200mhz or faster ram was $230+ for some cheap never heard of brands. So this upgrade was a steal at $75.. I wasn't sure if going from 2666 to 3600mhz ram was going to be worth it. I have a Ryzen 2600 and an asrock x370 motherboard. I know the 2600 doesn't officially support 3600mhz ram but figured I'd try it and worst case scenario I would down clock it to 3200mhz and still get an upgrade. Yes, I did try to overclock my ram and was only able to get to 2800 and that wasn't much of a difference so I just ran it at the 2666 speed to not have to worry about it dying.. I mostly play vr with my oculus rift on my pc. I sometimes play pc games but usually they are exclusives for pc and not on Xbox or PS4. I have noticed less stuttering on games (games are ran on high/ultra settings or/and supersampled). And all the reviews I read on performance increase in games and was expecting an increase from 2 to 15 frames. Which is a really good jump fro something below $100. Video cards you usually have to spent a little more to get that when comparing one card to the next higher model.. My oculus rift runs at 90hz per eye so I'm not sure how many frames dropped would let me see this. I imagine it depends on each person. But this ram works perfectly. I have not tried to overclock it.

I have a Logitech MX Keys keyboard that works just fine with the MacBook Pro M2 Max, but I wanted the convenience of the TouchID since I have the MacBook connected to a large monitor via a TS4 hub and didn't want to have to open the cover to log in every time. The key feel is excellent and having all the ""special"" Apple keys (e.g., the ""globe"" key) is a plus. The keyboard sits a little flat and Apple should add some retractable feet to the back edge like Logitech does. The SINGLE biggest disappointment for a ""premium"" keyboard is that the keys are not backlit! I just assumed they would be on Apple's ""best"" keyboard, and actually searched for a way to adjust the backlighting, until a quick bit of research uncovered the truth.

" April 24, 2023",Reviewed in the United States ,Johann Assam,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this version of the keyboard to get the fingerprint reader. Unexpectedly, the keyboard with black keys comes on a silver board. In the prior version, black keys were on a space-gray board.. See photo: upper is the old space-gray / black keyboard, lower is this new silver / black.. This is annoying for me, because it's looks cheaper and ugly. I like the space-gray look, which matches my space-gray macbook pro. What gives?! The silver board is normally paired with white keys only, so I guess they are trying to save money by ditching the space-gray option? Steve would not have approved this aesthetic!. Anyway, the keyboard itself, is a bit spring-ier than the old one. Actually feels better to type on. The fingerprint reader works great and now I don't have to type in my password every time sit down. Performance wise, I'm happy.. As with the old one, there are no adjustable feet. If you're like me and prefer a slanted keyboard, you'll need to get something to prop up the back top edge. Check out these rubber bumper pads: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PHZZ436.

" December 19, 2022",Reviewed in the United States ,Keith Hubert,4.0 out of 5 stars,"First and foremost, I gotta say that this is a GREAT keyboard and has a premium feel and build quality!! Touch ID works great and is highly responsive. I knocked off one star for lack of backlighting. I think a $200 keyboard should be backlit by default, bottom line. A much better price would be $149.99!!. Also, I want to address 99% of the negative reviews on this keyboard. If people took the time to research a product that they‚Äôre getting ready to pay $200 for, they‚Äôd save themselves some time in returns, headaches and unnecessary bad reviews. The product description CLEARLY states that this is for M1 MacBook Pros, not Intel-Based Macs and not guaranteed to work on Windows or Linux. Another bunch of bad reviews about bad serial numbers or not being able to register the keyboard baffle me as well as Apple has never had a system in place to ‚Äúregister‚Äù peripherals like Magic Mouse or Keyboards, they guarantee the peripherals for one year after date of purchase so all you need to do is store the box or take a pic of the serial number! There‚Äôs no need to register these products and there‚Äôs no way to do so. I hate to say this, but if u contacted apple because you couldn‚Äôt register the product online and they convinced you to buy directly from them, you‚Äôve been duped!! Overall, like I said, this is a premium keyboard made specifically for M1 Macs and works perfectly. My only gripe, and that‚Äôs mostly cause I suck typing and need to look at the keyboard all the time, is that it‚Äôs not backlit and for $200 it should be!!",4.0 out of 5 stars,/Apple-Keyboard-Numeric-Computers-Silicon/dp/B09V3JXSS9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,"Apple Magic Keyboard with Touch ID and Numeric Keypad: Wireless, Bluetooth, Rechargeable.

The first sentence is ""Only by making a place in our mobile device can mobile app development emphasize our brand name."" Does this mean ""To be popular, you need a mobile app""?. Still on page 1: ""Flutter and Dart are two app development technologies that can meet your requirements. We may compare the features and benefits of both frameworks and then make an informed decision on which framework would best suit our app concept."" This implies that we are going to choose between Flutter and Dart‚Äîbut only Flutter is a framework and it is built on Dart (a language, not a framework).. Page 2: ""in definition, creating a mobile application is a time-consuming and difficult task."" What does ""In definition"" add to that sentence? I assume the author meant ""By definition,"" but there isn't anything about the definition of a mobile application that makes it time-consuming or difficult.. Page 3: ""The Flutter app is written in the Dart programming language, which employs JIT (Just-in-Time) and AOT (Ahead-of-Time) compilation to increase [sic] total start-up time."" Compiling should _decrease_ (not increase) total start-up time.. I selected this book to use as a college textbook because I hoped that its recent publication implied that it would cover more of the recent features. But in its description of Flutter's history (page 4), we are told that ""On October 24, 2019, the framework's current stable release was Flutter v1.9.1+hotfix.6.""

I'll have to admit I was a bit worried about the proof reading on this ebook when the first page announced that it would have an Introduction to Fart! I am sure that F was meant to be a D since Flutter uses the Dart programming language. Now I've only reached page 20 at this point but it seems my fears were mistaken because the proof reader seems to have been awake ever since that first typo.

However, I know almost no OOP and do not find that to be a problem.. I have been teaching myself C# for my work. And watched a bunch of YouTube videos that actually are exceptional. However, almost all YouTube videos have a hard time slowing down to answer deeper questions. And I am always left with the question... ""Yea, I can see that works, but why does it work."" Books still provide a way to slow down and review a subject many times so it can be fully understood. Often better than a video. So Thank You to the authors for writing such a great book.. There is one large thing missing from this book. I wish they would format the example coding in the book the same as MS Visual Studio. Below are exerts from Chapter 4... One line describing the C# ""new"" keyword. And another line using the word ""new"". It might be obvious to the reader how the term ""new"" is being used on each line below. However, remember that I just pointed this out. It is not always obvious. The book is full of examples like this.. 1.) As an alternative, you can create structure variables using the C# new keyword, which will invoke the structure‚Äôs default constructor.. 2.) Next, add the following to the end of the Main method to create and dispose of the new struct:. Now... I am sure the authors have purposely formatted the whole book in black and white for some reason.

The vacuum‚Äôs movements are swift, moving not too slow and not too fast which is perfect for making sure its picking up the dirt or crumbs. The noise level is much lower than I expected, but any vacuum is going to make some sort of noise. its not loud enough to bother us, in fact if you put it in a room to clean and close the door (highly recommend doing that for cleaning specific areas at one time) you can barely hear it!

" October 19, 2023",Reviewed in the United States ,Cesar,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I recently purchased the robot vacuum and mop combo, and it has been a game-changer for my home. This device has simplified my cleaning routine and exceeded my expectations in several ways.. First, the vacuuming capabilities are impressive. It navigates around furniture and obstacles with ease, and the suction power is strong enough to pick up dirt, pet hair, and debris from both hard floors and carpets. The vacuum also has smart sensors to prevent it from falling down stairs or getting stuck in tight spaces.. The mopping function is a great addition. It dispenses water and cleaning solution in a controlled manner, ensuring my floors are not soaked but still get a thorough clean. The mop attachment can be easily removed and washed, making maintenance a breeze.. The robot can be controlled through a smartphone app, allowing me to schedule cleaning sessions or start it remotely. It also has voice command compatibility with virtual assistants, which is very convenient.. Battery life is decent, and it automatically returns to its charging dock when low on power. The dustbin and water tank are easy to empty and refill.. One minor drawback is that it occasionally gets stuck under low furniture or on loose cords, but this is a common issue with most robot vacuums.. In summary, the robot vacuum and mop combo has made my life easier by keeping my floors clean with minimal effort. It's a worthwhile investment for anyone looking to simplify their cleaning routine.",5.0 out of 5 stars,/ZCWA-Mopping-Schedule-Settings-Self-Charging/dp/B0C2872HLV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,"ZCWA Robot Vacuum and Mop Combo, 2 in 1 Mopping Robotic Vacuum with WiFi/App/Alexa, Robotic Vacuum Cleaner, Schedule Settings, Self-Charging, Ideal for Hard Floor, Pet Hair and Carpet"

I have a cat and a shedding dog and have had a lot of success with the sweeping robovac. But their footprints reflecting off the bamboo flooring drive me insane so I decided to try a mopping combo. I run it every day or two and what it covers looks nice. It's small so I need to refill every time and usually empty once mid-session....but I was.prepared for this.. However:. 1) it is pretty obsessed with my dining kitchen area (near it's ""home""). It only ventures out to other areas occasionally and does a couple criss-crosses and then back to comfort zone. I even tried picking it up and starting from the living room....and it still didn't stay long. It took me a little while to realize this because I don't pay that much attention when it's running (the whole point of using it üôÇ). I just tried moving it's charging station so I don't know if that impacts. I've had two previous sweeping only vacs (frugal price) and never experienced this. ü´§. 2) it gets stuck so, SO easily. Like, can barely get over the transition piece between kitchen and dining area. It needs rescuing somewhat regularly. Not the end of the world, but annoying at times. Maybe it needs a little life coaching from the little train that could.. 3) One other thing that takes a little diligance,.. the front flap for the ""mop"" sometimes gets untucked and then it doesn't clean quite right so you have to stop and adjust.. I put a little tape on the back that I can tuck it under and that helps a little.. All in all, I suppose I get what I pay for... but the non-random thing kind of defeats the purpose.

The RGB lighting is gorgeous and syncs well with my motherboard. The performance is also top-notch, with fast speeds and low latency. The installation was easy, and the packaging was nice.. The only minor issue I have is that the RAM sticks are quite tall and they barely fit under my CPU cooler. I had to adjust the fan position a bit to make some room. It's not a big deal, but it would have been nice if they were a bit shorter or had a low-profile option..

" July 31, 2023",Reviewed in the United States ,Logan Bouchard,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great value as of the time I‚Äôm writing this for DDR4 RAM at 3600mhz speed with RGB. Not to mention 32gb total capacity! (16x2 in dual channel), 32gb with where AAA games are going seems like it‚Äôll be the eventual sweet spot of the future. Plus the extra memory for now (relative to 16gb) will be great for video editing and other memory intensive tasks like VMs if I choose to mess with that. This should last me until I eventually upgrade to AM5 much further down the road once that platform fully matures and I feel like I really ‚Äúneed‚Äù to upgrade from my 5800X3D.. Got this kit mainly to replace my old janky 16gb (8x2) kit that was for some reason starting to give me BSOD and start-up issues. Just general system instability overall, but that old kit I had was from an unknown brand so it is what it is. It got through 3 1/2 years of heavy use so I‚Äôm fine with it.. Moving back to this kit even though its CL18 rated with its default XMP profile it‚Äôs fine as X3D parts don‚Äôt seem to be affected that much from cas latency relative to standard AMD CPUs. Must be the large amount of additional cache built directly into the processor. I could manually tune it hypothetically, but the trial and error headache to find stable timings isn't worth the extremely minute bit of performance I'd potentially squeeze out.. All-in-all happy with my purchase.

" October 30, 2022",Reviewed in the United States ,Nelson V.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"In case you're confused on the headline, I decided to do a TUF Gaming build. Now this isn't an original idea, but when I went poking around to do a new build, its something I came up with on my own... initially.. So when I went around the internet forums looking for ideas, I came across a video build of the ASUS TUF variety. This person was building a rig that housed almost ALL ASUS branded hardware. This piqued my interest, so I went around collecting all the goodies, including this ram.. The T-Force ram group is new to me, since i'm coming from corsair and gskill. But I wanted to stay as true to the TUF theme as possible, and the video had these listed so I gave it a shot. The qvl ASUS has for the TUF Gaming X570 pro WIFI II doesn't list these, so bear that in mind if you're not going to bend in that regard.. Moving on.... Install is straight forward and simple, you can only install it 1 way. The other way breaks the ram or ram slot, so don't do that. They are of the same dimensions as your typical stick of ram, with the typical rgb lighting in the typical spot.. Heatsinks are good, nothing was peeling off when I examined them for any obvious defects. Overall, your typical ram.. RGB however, was a different story. And its also why I subtracted a star for stability. As of this writing, they're behaving with the aura sync software provided by ASUS and supposedly supported by T-Force.. What's happening, is when a rgb theme is loaded up (starry night in ASUS armor crate, check it out), it'll run like it's supposed to. However after a few hours, or a day, i'll notice that one of the ram sticks has locked itself on 2 colors and nothing else. No movement of color, no fade, no nothing. And just one stick, not the other. Now i'm not sure if its the rgb, or the software. There's no way to test rgb unfortunately. I'm going to assume and say its the software because i reinstalled the armor crate which the aura sync runs under, and for the time being that stick of ram is behaving. But that could change.. Anyhow, I have 2 sticks slotted into that ASUS TUF X570 pro I mentioned, supporting a ryzen 7 5800x and having no issues. For you gamers, i've run Star Citizen at max settings, and you number crunchers I run World Community Grid and i'm cranking out completed tasks. Both of these are accomplished with zero lag while doing other tasks on the pc (youtube, newsfeeds, etc etc). No, the ram is not overclocked. I'll tinker with memclocks and voltages when winter rolls around and everything shuts down (I live in the north, snow sucks).. In the end, buy with confidence. I took a chance on another brand and for now, its paying off. Good luck on your build!",4.0 out of 5 stars,/TEAMGROUP-T-Force-3200MHz-PC4-25600-TF3D432G3200HC16FDC01/dp/B08PV1QQJX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,TEAMGROUP T-Force Delta RGB DDR4 32GB (2x16GB) 3200MHz (PC4-25600) CL16 Desktop Memory Module Ram TF3D432G3200HC16FDC01 - Black

Nice and pretty with glossy pages and designed more for the at home mom that has zero net experience and wants to learn Wordpress and start a blog. The front and back cover both exceed the width of the pages and have a fold back flap that makes it awkward to open and deal with book pages. Glossy pages with small print can be difficult to see and the glossy pastel colors do not help matters either. The TOC is a black background with white letters. Entirely poor use of color in the book as far as something designed to teach. As mentioned, more of a coffee table book.. Appears to be good knowledge in the book but if you already have a host or have experience in the internet world you can cut out the first 36 pages and go to chapter 5. I did, I even cut off the front and back covers to make using the book much easier. Information is presented in too wordy of a format. What can take two lines to explain ends up taking one or two paragraphs. I almost felt like a 5 year being taught wash his hands.. I gave up on the book at the end of chapter 5 and tossed it into the trash. If you need a coffee table book, then this is the one to buy.

" September 12, 2013",Reviewed in the United States ,Fred Sabin,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Create your own Website using Wordpress In a Weekend. Focal Press / Taylor and Francis Group. Copyright ¬© 2013 The Ilex Press Ltd.. ISBN: 978-0-415-66268-0 (pbk). Fred Sabin (President, New Jersey Computer Club) Review - September 9, 2013. The New Jersey Computer Club (NJCC) is a not-for-profit organization dedicated to educating the public about computer systems, software, and their uses; providing community service to charities and educational groups; and sharing knowledge and social activities with other computer enthusiasts. A frequent topic of discussion is how to create and upgrade websites. In my opinion, this book is well written and a comprehensive reference on everything associated with this topic (using Wordpress).. There are numerous software programs and other tools available for creating a website. Unfortunately, many are either very simple (fill in the blanks) that limit creativity, or complex requiring a knowledge of HTML or another programming aid. This book is a welcome compromise that combines step by step instructions, with explanations on what you are doing and how to alter it for upgrades or additional modifications. It would be especially useful for small business applications with a limited budget, and would integrate well into a business plan to help define your business purpose, focus, and marketing components.. I did find the book title of ""in a weekend"" misleading in that the ""what you will need in advance"" (domain name, hosting, professional photographs, logo, legal issues, PayPal, etc.) combined with ""creating a website"" activities may require time commitments over many days to complete. Fortunately, the well presented detailed instructions and extensive references will allow the creation of an excellent website without the need to search for additional information. In fact, the well organized references make this book an excellent source to upgrade or modify any existing website.. This is a book that you could skim through in a couple of hours (leaving out the details) to get an excellent grasp of the versatility of websites; a learning tool to gain specific knowledge about an area of website interest; or a technical reference to find detailed information on a specific website component. To properly use the book to create a professional website, however, will probably take many hours over many days, but you will gain an excellent understanding of your final product and will be able to make improvements to it when necessary.. I would therefore recommend ""Create your own Website using Wordpress (in a weekend)"" to our NJCC membership and others as a self help tool for creating or modifying a website.",4.0 out of 5 stars,/Create-Website-Using-Wordpress-Weekend-ebook/dp/B01M0ZY1CG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,Create Your Own Website (Using Wordpress) in a Weekend

" August 30, 2013",Reviewed in the United States ,B. Morrison,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Even if you are a technophobe, this book will take you by the hand and help you get your website up in no time.. I bought this book a year after failing to design a website using the ""WordPress for Dummies"" book. I'm a graphic designer who specializes in print, and had been dreading the thought of learning WordPress in order to redesign my portfolio website. After getting nowhere with the Dummies book, I purchased this one and had a preliminary site up within 24 hours.. The book walks you through every step--from selecting a domain name and hosting plan to purchasing themes and stock images. There are even sections about growing your audience and legal issues. Alannah Moore's writing style is clear, and free of off-putting technobabble.. Whats more--the layout is beautiful and really user friendly. There are lots of example images and tip boxes. I found myself flipping through the book just for fun!",5.0 out of 5 stars,/Create-Website-Using-Wordpress-Weekend-ebook/dp/B01M0ZY1CG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,Create Your Own Website (Using Wordpress) in a Weekend
" September 16, 2013",Reviewed in the United States ,Elzi Hunter,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had my wordpress website up for a year, but I have not always been able to make quick changes without resorting to calling my website designer or techie friends for help. With 'Create Your Website,' I was able to quickly tab through the correctly labelled table of contents to find what I needed. I have added video to my website and now know how to add PayPal buttons - WITHOUT having to pay for hours of development time or wait until someone can help me.. This book empowered me to do a lot of things on my own - quickly and easily, without frustration. I have saved money and now have a flexible website. I can change things as I see fit, when I see fit.. Whether you are a novice creating your first website or a little more advanced but searching for specialized tips on beefing up your website, growing your audience or making quick modifications, this book is a must-have on your bookshelf.",5.0 out of 5 stars,/Create-Website-Using-Wordpress-Weekend-ebook/dp/B01M0ZY1CG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,Create Your Own Website (Using Wordpress) in a Weekend
" January 3, 2014",Reviewed in the United States ,languido,5.0 out of 5 stars,"There were 15 beginners Wordpress books at my local bookstore, and this one stood out from the rest because it is beautifully designed and a pleasure to look at. The information is presented very clearly, with photographs and screenshots illustrating every single step of the way, while also anticipating questions you may have. It's fairly short--160 pages--made shorter by the fact that every page is taken up by screenshots of what you will see on your computer. I bought it yesterday, Friday, afternoon, and my first Wordpress website is already halfway done today, Saturday midday. I have no doubt I will finish it this weekend!. The commenter who subtracted a star because some basic ingredients --like a photograph--were required is being unrealistic. Nobody can teach you how to cook a three course meal in five minutes if you don't have any food in your kitchen. And even if you don't have any ingredients, the author gives you links to websites where you can quickly download them for free.",5.0 out of 5 stars,/Create-Website-Using-Wordpress-Weekend-ebook/dp/B01M0ZY1CG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,Create Your Own Website (Using Wordpress) in a Weekend

I searched the WWW and borrowed several other books from the library, but it was this one that made it relatively easy and painless. My web site - positivelyquit.com - on which I direct visitors to Amazon to buy my ebook - was up in just slightly longer than a weekend. Now I'm highly comfy with WordPress.

" November 20, 2013",Reviewed in the United States ,Alice,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The book is very easy reading and comprehensible with lots of illustrations and photos to help you understand what you should do. After reading the book, which gave me the certainty to create my own website using WordPress, I had the chance to meet with Alannah, the author, because she also organizes workshops in London and Paris to help you step by step. I guess I have never enjoyed so much any courses or workshops which I've participated in the past. As all of us have different reasons and needs for our websites, she works in a very personalized way to explain things according to our needs. So not only would I recommend you buy the book, but you should definitely attend her workshops as well! Now I cannot wait to start my own. Thanks again Alannah!!!",5.0 out of 5 stars,/Create-Website-Using-Wordpress-Weekend-ebook/dp/B01M0ZY1CG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,Create Your Own Website (Using Wordpress) in a Weekend
" September 10, 2016",Reviewed in the United States ,CharLena Pearson,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This was my first audio/visual book that I watched on my PC. On that note, I initially was watching it without sound and kept wondering why no sound was provided. The button for the sound is not in a place I usually look, which down along the bottom of the screen. That is an Amazon review rather than about the author or book.. This A/V book was quite informative. I've used the Amazon DIY cover before, but Chris Navarre enlightened me on the more easily and correct use of the program, plus gives another free place to get pictures if Amazon's free pix are not doing for you or your book. This is a perfect show, tell and use book. Great and easy conversational instructions that anyone can understand. I look forward to seeing and experiencing other A/V books by Mr. Navarre.",4.0 out of 5 stars,/How-Create-eBook-Cover-Amazon/dp/B01HYHWP72/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,How to Create an eBook Cover on Amazon - DIY

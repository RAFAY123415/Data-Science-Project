# Data-Science-Project

#### About Project Expalantion :

#####  • The dataset is collected from kaggle link is given in the .ipynb file you can download from there  .

#####  • I fallow Crisp-DM Modelling Process to solve my problem .

#####  • I fallow all the step to understand our dataset like (No of Rows and Columns , Skewness , Datatypes of Columns ) .

#####  • In data preparation i extract important features from the dataset as most of the features are not in the standard format so i applied (Feature Engeering ,Data Preprocessing ) Technique to make our data in standard format .

#####  • After Data Preparation i apply all the Regression assumption techniques to test our data .

#####  • As most of the features do not cause overfitting so i did not use ridge and lasso regression i simply use regression for our problem before applying the regression i normalize the data by using standard scaler .

#####  • At the last step i predict the minimum and maximum price in range .
